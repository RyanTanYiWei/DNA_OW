A caste of loyal stain removers; As long as the minister doesn't stumble; Top civil servants are more often loyal than knowledgeable. They are mainly concerned with keeping their minister out of the wind.

ABSTRACT
 Official culture
For top civil servants, it is not the general interest that comes first, but the protection of the minister. According to them, politicians themselves provoke this. "Continuing to say no sounds heroic, but it has no effect whatsoever."
COMPLETE TEXT:
It is one of the many disappearing acts at ministries in The Hague: if you, as a minister or state secretary, have sensitive comments on an official memo and you want to prevent this from ever becoming public, you use post-its. Those yellow pieces of paper with an adhesive edge that you quickly stick on such a document - and more importantly, remove it quickly.
Sometimes it is convenient in The Hague to let information disappear from view. If a minister knows that something has gone wrong, for example during bombings in Syria, he must tell the House of Representatives. If he doesn't, he will get into trouble. But if he does, too. For image and career it is better not to know some things.
All kinds of things get lost in The Hague, and not just Teeven's infamous receipt.
In the recent benefits affair at the Tax Authorities, the tax authorities appeared to have wrongly accused hundreds of families of fraud with their childcare benefits. Internal warnings and publications about this were long denied or downplayed by the top management of the Tax Authorities and the Ministry of Finance. Ultimately, State Secretary Menno Snel (D66) had to admit that too many mistakes had been made by civil servants and that this was still happening. He resigned in December.
The same pattern can be seen in affairs involving the CBR, the National Police, the Public Prosecution Service, the UWV or the NVWA: politicians under fire who first "do not recognize themselves in the image" of critical publications. Only to almost always have to give in later. that it is correct.
Why can things go wrong in public administration for so long without anyone raising their hand, intervening and taking responsibility? In the House of Representatives, many fingers point at top officials. They would function poorly and could also blunder with impunity.
How do civil servants themselves see this? In recent weeks, NRC spoke with almost twenty (former) top civil servants, (former) politicians and former directors of implementation organizations.
Often, they say, things go well of course. But when push comes to shove, when the government makes mistakes, or when controversial or ambitious political plans have to be converted into complex policy, then the civil service shows harmful reflexes.
Almost all of them describe an anxious, uncertain and inward-looking world. Where substantive knowledge, reality outside the ministry and the general interest lose out to obsessive protection of the minister's image.
And the latter, many interviewees emphasize, is exactly what ministers want.


Score tomorrow
or how there is no longer room for reservations from civil servants
When Henk Kamp took office as Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment in the Balkenende I cabinet in 2002, he addressed the officials gathered in the hall of his ministry: "You are in favor of continuity, I am in favor of change. And we keep each other in balance."
It is precisely that balance that is missing, say many top officials interviewed. A consultant who works a lot for ministries saw it happen: "Today's ministers are in an incredible hurry and, hunted by opposition and media, want to score tomorrow. No one is anymore interested in civil servants who calmly investigate something, list the pros and cons, and present scenarios. These are often seen as obstacles to the minister's success."
"A minister only has knowledge of the field by chance," says Tjibbe Joustra, who ended a thirty-year career as a top civil servant in 2011. "So he has to have people around him who are annoying and say: 'This is not going to work. ' But for that you need ministers who seek out contradiction and are curious, and I don't always see that. There is relatively little substantive debate taking place."
There are two types of civil servants, a former civil servant was once told during an internal course. One acts based on knowledge of his field, considers matters substantively, and feels professional. "The second type, we heard, knows exactly when to take on the color of the wallpaper." In other words: when to go along with your political boss.
This civil servant soon left the Civil Service. "I didn't immediately run when the minister asked something, I made my own decisions. Then you won't move up quickly."
Pieter Cloo alternated positions in government and business for many years, until he became Secretary General of the Ministry of Justice. "I thought that a minister should gather strong people around him," he says. "But I see more cautious process managers at the top who often do not take their own position. This means that problems are not put on the table enough."
Of course, there are still civil servants who repeatedly warn their ministers about bad ideas - this also happened when the tax authorities introduced benefits. But anyone who does that too often falls out of favor. An unwritten rule is that you may contradict a request from your minister twice, but you must carry it out the third time. A top official: "Continuing to say no sounds heroic, but it has no effect whatsoever. Then someone else will be put in your place who will do it."
The increased political fragmentation is further sidelining civil servants. In the past, as a civil servant you worked towards Friday. The Council of Ministers then made decisions about the plans that ministries had come up with. But in the current four-party coalition, the most politically sensitive issues are often dealt with in the coalition consultations on Monday morning. That's where the party leaders, faction leaders and the minister who is in trouble at that moment come. Civil servants are not included.
What emerges from the Monday meeting is usually a hard-won political compromise. At the end of last year, for example, the decision was made to reduce the national speed limit to 100. A contradicting official then immediately leads to political unrest. Nobody wants that.


THE ART OF NO HASSLE
or how you survive as a civil servant by keeping your minister out of the wind
To flourish at the top of the civil service, experts say, you must master 'the art of not making a fuss'. Civil servants must be 'politically sensitive', a concept that receives a lot of attention in civil service classes. Incoming politicians ask for a "safe pair of hands".
A former top civil servant describes it this way: "You have to be able to stay out of trouble, be able to move smoothly with the issues of the day, keep the House of Representatives satisfied and the minister out of the wind. These are all qualities that are of no use to the homeland, but they are essential for survival."
Almost all interviewees agree on one thing: loyalty comes first, you move mountains to prevent your minister from having to explain in Parliament why something went wrong under his responsibility. Public administration is so large and complex that something always goes wrong somewhere. There are hardly any politicians left with the will or ability to accept this reality, say the interviewees. And then the pressure arises to hide or deny a problem. “Keep it small,” is what the ministries say.
The fact that politicians can hardly accept bad news anymore is also due to their vulnerability. Government parties - the VVD is an exception - have been punished by voters in recent years. Social media and a more critical press can make it seem as if every mistake, incident or not, is whipped up to hurricane force. A top civil servant: "As a minister you are successful by not failing. The question is no longer: 'how do I create successful policy in the three years that I have?' Every week that closes on Friday without a crisis is a great week. If that is the game, the culture at the top will also change." Joustra: "Change is not without pain and risks. But everything is aimed at preventing accidents and hiding."
At the end of 2014, the Ministry of Justice received a critical report on the implementation of the criminal order, which allows the Public Prosecution Service to sentence citizens to fines and community service without judicial intervention. The most responsible official did not want to read it. Minister Opstelten also had to "be able to say that it is all new to him and that he has to study it". This meant that the minister did not have to respond to the substantive criticism.
Civil servants must protect ministers, says Wim Kuijken, who was Secretary General of the Interior for fifteen years. "But it should never go so far as to brush away unwelcome noises about the policy desired by the minister. But that does happen."
Jet Bussemaker, who was State Secretary of Health, Welfare and Sport and Minister of Education, Culture and Science for the PvdA: "Of course, as a politician you want to be warned about banana peels and that serious problems are discussed with you. On the other hand, you're not looking forward to it; You have enough problems as it is.”
An ideal civil servant can process large flows of information, recognize what the minister needs to know and handle the rest himself. But that requires control of their files. Fewer and fewer top civil servants are getting around to doing that.
One reason is that they change jobs so quickly that more than half no longer meet the internal standard of five years in a post - that time is considered necessary to operate effectively for a few years. A third even stayed in the same position for less than the minimum standard of three years, an analysis of career data shows.
But there is also, say those involved, a disdain for substantive knowledge. A top civil servant describes high-level official meetings in his field. "I heard people there saying complete nonsense with great self-confidence. Too many decisions are made based on first impressions and without any analysis.”
A former minister saw a Secretary General with a lot of professional knowledge leave because he was at the end of his term. The successor found that kind of expertise at the top of the civil service "completely unnecessary". "When I asked why, he said: 'It is important for us that we can bundle the correct information.'"


RAMS ON THE EXECUTION
or how reality loses out to political wishful thinking in the ministerial towers
"Politics consists of new ideas, and then reality often gets in the way," says Pieter Cloo. If he wanted to make a working visit to implementation services to see whether the official plans were working, he always had to go through resistance from colleagues. "Insecure ministers also preferred it if top officials stayed nearby."
A civil servant who wants to achieve success cannot be guided by the world outside the ministry. Success is: getting policy or legislation through the House for your minister. A civil servant who does this must serve four worlds: the House of Representatives, which must vote in favor; the Ministry of Finance, which must agree to the budgetary implications; the Council of State, which tests the legal tenability of bills; and implementation services such as the SVB or the UWV, which use an 'implementation test' to determine whether the plans can be implemented. Only the latter group can be influenced by civil servants, and that is happening a lot. "If an implementation agency threatened to say that something was not possible, we said to each other: 'We still have to hammer on implementation,'" says a former civil servant. In this way, political desirability wins over reality.
This happened, for example, in 2015, when the Social Insurance Bank wanted to write to the Ministers of Health and Social Affairs that a crisis plan to restart the stalled payment of the personal budget was "impossible" and would pose "irresponsible risks". State Secretary Martin van Rijn (PvdA) had already promised the House that he would quickly solve the problems with the personal budget. Officials returned the draft letter from the Social Insurance Bank six times with corrections. Ultimately, the letter only stated that the crisis plan "needed some further elaboration". The plan did not work.
Pier Eringa was boss at ProRail for four years, and during that time regularly clashed with 'his' ministers. “At the ministry, civil servants with knowledge of the railways can be counted on the fingers of one hand. While 2 billion goes there every year. There is no interest in the outside world at all. I really had to get officials to come and see what we were doing."
For citizens, implementation services are the face of the government, they have contact with it. But within the civil service, 'implementation' has less status than 'policy'. You can score with new policy, as a politician and therefore also as a civil servant. Working for an executive organization is a major risk for your civil service career. Everyone in The Hague knows: ministers never argue about policy, always about implementation. Making policy is safe, especially if you change roles quickly enough. Then you are usually gone before the implementation problems of your plans make the newspapers.
A top official: "Drinks and parties are held when the Senate has approved new policy or new legislation. The implementation problems will come after your time. We all participate in that.”

DISAPPEARING TRICKS
or how harmful information disappears from The Hague
"The attitude within the top civil service is too often: what you know bothers you," says Pier Eringa. "A lot of things are not emailed and written that should be, strategic minutes are taken, because they know : if there is a Wob or parliamentary inquiry, then it will come true." The Government Information (Public Access) Act (Wob) gives citizens the right to have administrative information made public.
Eringa: "I have been hit on the head often enough because I sent such a letter, or when I wanted to give an interview. First the director calls, then the director general, then the secretary general - asking if I wanted to withdraw. If nothing else works, you get the minister on the phone."
Almost all civil servants interviewed saw how information was suppressed. If you, as a minister, want to be able to say in Parliament that a document containing unpleasant information "has not reached you", then you ensure that you get your hands on it "outside the formal line". If someone threatens to put something sensitive in an email, you ask him if it wouldn't be better to call or come by, that leaves no trace.
When unwelcome letters arrive, writers are sometimes asked to amend the letters or, better yet, withdraw them. Sometimes this comes true, such as when the mayor of Eindhoven sent a critical letter to Justice about the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security in 2016.
Last week, NRC reported that the Ministry of the Interior had a critical report from the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate designated an "internal document". The report concluded that the decentralization of spatial planning poses problems. The Interior is currently trying to stop this decentralization. to complete by piloting the Environmental Act through parliament, and was not looking forward to the criticism.
The top official emerges from the conversations as a troubled creature. At the mercy of impossible demands from insecure politicians, who increasingly use civil servants themselves as a scapegoat. Who are always busy with their next position, because they have to leave the civil service if they have been in a job for more than seven years. Who are terrified that they will accidentally give their minister bad press, because that is also a scratch on their own career. Who panic at the thought that one day they will lose their anonymity because their name is linked to a political miscalculation. The word 'fear' comes up in almost all conversations.
A top civil servant who once appeared in the news with his first and last name, tells how all kinds of colleagues subsequently contacted him: "They said, this could happen to me every day." He laughs. "Suddenly I thought: 'This is a traumatized caste'.”
Everything is aimed at preventing accidents and hiding
Tjibbe Joustra former top civil servant
This is part two
of a diptych about Dutch top officials.
Part one, about the civil service job carousel, appeared on Friday.
For this part, NRC spoke to almost twenty (former) top civil servants, (former) politicians and former directors of executive organizations, often with decades of experience with the government. Five of them are quoted by name, the others agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity. Most of the latter still work for the government.
