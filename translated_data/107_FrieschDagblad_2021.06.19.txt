Harlingen The municipality of Harlingen calls on residents to think about the future of their living environment. Harlingen uses an online questionnaire to collect as many ideas as possible from residents in order to draw up the environmental vision. In the context of the new Environmental Act, this will have to replace all current zoning plans.
