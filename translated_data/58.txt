This week, the umpteenth episode in the long-running political drama called the Environmental Act took place in a room of the Senate. With a remarkable compromise, Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Housing) managed to prevent a sixth postponement of the law at the eleventh hour.
Just briefly what it's about. There are various laws, regulations and authorities in spatial policy. For a somewhat complicated renovation, you therefore have to apply for different permits at different counters. This should be simpler, thought the second Rutte cabinet and came up with the Environmental Act: a bundling of all laws and regulations behind one counter. So that citizens and entrepreneurs can complete their application in one go. Then Minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen (Infrastructure and Environment) called the operation 'the largest legislative operation since the constitutional amendment of 1848'. Schultz wanted the law to come into effect in 2017, we are now at January 1, 2023.
The problem is not with the admittedly extensive and complex legislation. The stumbling block lies in something that did not bother Thorbecke in his time: ICT. The success of the Environmental Act depends on the idea that a citizen can submit his application online, and that an ICT system initiates that complex process. But that system, DSO, is (still) not ready for it, or at least: that is feared.
The Senate also has that fear, hence the compromise. De Jonge is allowed to continue with the introduction, but the Senate retains the right to say 'no' in the autumn, when the ICT Assessment Advisory Board makes a judgment on DSO. And so a sixth postponement is still up in the air.
The Environmental Act is a drawn-out drama that does not lead to dramatic scenes. The news did not open with it, no MPs became heated and no minister got into trouble because of it. It remains fodder for specialized MPs, civil servants and trade magazines.
Political scandals are about execution. Whether it is the surcharges, or the Fyra fast train, or the gas extraction problem in Groningen: the fuss always comes after it appears that a decision has turned out to be disastrous. It is a well-known complaint that there is too little attention for tough technical decision-making and too much for incidents.
The good thing about the Environmental Act is that the brakes are being applied before it is introduced. That the law is not pushed through with steam and boiling water because it is politically desirable.
Precisely because the Environmental Act has remained a technical law for legal and construction specialists, doubts can arise before implementation. And it is not a political defeat for the minister if the introduction is delayed. Of course, the question is how desirable it is if the introduction of a law takes so long. But it is always better than quickly pushing through a law that turns out not to work well in practice.
