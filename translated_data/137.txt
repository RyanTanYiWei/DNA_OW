The Hague The introduction of the Environmental Act will be postponed again by six months. Minister Hugo de Jonge (Spatial Planning) reports to the House of Representatives that the law must come into effect on January 1, 2024.
This is the fifth time that the introduction of the law, which was already adopted in 2016, has been postponed.
The Environmental Act should bundle dozens of laws and rules for spatial planning, making it easier to obtain a building permit, for example. Municipalities will be able to do this in the future via a digital counter.
The intention was that the law would come into effect last New Year, but the Senate did not agree to this. The computer system required by the law was not secure or stable enough for a long time. The ICT Assessment Advisory Board concluded that there were still 'significant limitations' in the so-called Digital System Environment Act (DSO).
The technology is now in order, the Ministry of the Interior reports. Municipalities and the business community wanted enough time to arrange everything before the new system comes into effect. That is why January 1 was chosen.
