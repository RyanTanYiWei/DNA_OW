The Hague
 The Senate has agreed that the Environmental Act will come into effect on January 1 next year. This puts an end to the long drawn-out process of the law.
In the roll call vote, 41 senators were in favor and 29 against. The Nanninga faction helped the coalition gain a majority. Left-wing parties in particular were against: they are concerned about the soundness and feasibility of the law. The law was already passed by the Senate in 2016, but its introduction was postponed several times. The complexity of the law, the corona crisis and IT problems, among other things, stood in the way of its introduction.
The Environmental Act is intended to bundle dozens of laws and regulations for spatial planning, so that it becomes easier to obtain a building permit, for example. This must be done via a digital counter. For a long time it was questionable whether this system was stable and/or safe enough. But provinces, municipalities and water boards, which have to work with the system, consider the introduction as of January 1 responsible. Earlier this year they supported this proposal from Minister Hugo de Jonge and urged them to quickly provide clarity to politicians. According to him, governments and the business community can now definitively adjust their organization and work processes to provide the most adequate possible service to the business community and construction consumers.
