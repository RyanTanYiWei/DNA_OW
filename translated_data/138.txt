The new extensive Environmental Act will not be introduced until January 1, 2023. Minister Hugo de Jonge, who is responsible for spatial planning, has communicated this to the Senate and House of Representatives. According to the minister, the postponement offers all parties involved the opportunity to practice properly with the new digital system and the new procedures. The new law was supposed to be introduced several years ago, but has already been postponed several times due to its complexity and the new IT systems required. At the beginning of February, De Jonge announced that the introduction on July 1 of this year would also not be achieved.
