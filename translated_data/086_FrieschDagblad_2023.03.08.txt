Highlight: Leeuwarden The United Nations has the Social Development Goals, and these SDGs are also known to Fryslân: together, sustainable and healthy. There is no longer any need to investigate this. This was said by director Ingrid van de Vegte of the Fries Social Planning Office (FSP) at her farewell symposium on Tuesday afternoon in De Harmonie in Leeuwarden.

“If you bring those goals together, you will have a bright future. Then it is still a matter of realization," said Van de Vegte in her contribution 'Findings in Friesland and a look at the future'. "And then it does not help to focus blindly on 2030. Because that will be in ten years' time. 2040. An overarching story is needed for Fryslân: based on history, individuality, and what is important to us: in iepen mienskip fan mear nei better."
Decentralizations
Van de Vegte outlined the assignments that provinces and municipalities will receive from The Hague in the coming years: she counted 24 files, of which clean water and energy transition are two, and where mobility, the Lely Line and the Environmental Act may be added. According to Van de Vegte, the social domain file shows that such decentralization is a difficult task: "That has not necessarily benefited the citizen. What? Cutbacks, crowds, scaling up in government, and a great need for knowledge because of the complexity."
She called the fact that Fryslân has gone from 31 to eighteen municipalities in ten years, for reasons of scale, as a direct consequence. “And eighteen is still too many. Fryslân is actually one large municipality, comparable to Rotterdam, but with more connections. And more cooperation is needed."
A basic document
Because the files that are being transferred have already largely been drawn up, Frisian municipalities and the province can only color in some details and must mainly implement them. With a joint vision for the longer term, recorded in a basic document, and to which regional and local authorities commit themselves, Fryslân can work on its own interpretation.
However, due to that heavier task package, it will still "squeak and creak." It's too much for what we can do, what we have the knowledge for, it's too complex. And who monitors the integrality?" Coherent, sustainable policy does not just mean focusing on a nitrogen target in 2030, but viewing everything from a helicopter, weighing it up and deciding on it, according to Van de Vegte. An independent committee should be set up for this Directors and elected officials make decisions, this committee tests them against the basic document and the SDGs.
Bilingual education
In practice, according to Van de Vegte, this means agriculture with good earnings for the farmer whose environment eats, a circular industry, the peat meadow back in its original state as a nature reserve and for CO2 storage, companies that only receive a permit for activities if they contribute to broad prosperity, no interventions in the landscape if they do not fit, long-term lifestyle programs for a healthier life - "this often takes generations" -, a major role for culture and language - "it is important that all children Learn Frisian, and that there is no gap between those who have mastered it and those who have not, but are proud of being bilingual" - and no one leaves school with low literacy.
The FSP director, who left on March 1, sees another advantage in the collaborating Frisian authorities: the knowledge of complex tasks remains in one place, and that also keeps Frisian bright minds here because of the variety of challenges they face in such a job. to stand. The mienskip already contains many 'accelerators', look, for example, at the people working on the energy transition in the villages, Van de Vegte told her audience, around two hundred people. Make use of their knowledge. And the fact that so many Frisians want to contribute to their living environment, especially young people, is an advantage when tackling the major challenges of the future.
Fryslân should keep the important dates for all those assignments in one place. According to Van de Vegte, the Frisian Social Planning Bureau should therefore be transformed into a regional Environmental Planning Agency, so that it can be given a broader task. As a farewell gift, that wish was fulfilled on Tuesday: the FSP was renamed Planningbureau Fryslân (PF).
