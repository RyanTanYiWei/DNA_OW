  Leiden Ten regional municipalities have been jointly nominated for the 'Aandeslag trophy' of the national program 'Getting started with the Environmental Act'.
 Leiden, Katwijk, Noordwijk, Oegstgeest, Leiderdorp, Zoeterwoude, Voorschoten, Wassenaar, Teylingen and Kaag en Braassem are working together with the Rijnland Water Board on the Hart van Holland Environmental Vision. And such a collaboration is unique in the Netherlands, according to Heleen Groot, director of the 'Getting started with the Environmental Act' programme. "Leiden as the largest municipality and Zoeterwoude as the smallest both pulled off the route as major go-getters." The nomination was presented during a conference where the ten municipalities and the water board made their appearance. Leiden councilor Fleur Spijker is happy: "This nomination is a token of appreciation from the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. A confirmation that the process is an example for the Netherlands. Her colleague Ton de Gans from Zoeterwoude: "A lack of space is complex. Companies, residents and municipalities increasingly need each other in this regard." Minister Ollongren will present the trophy on September 10. There are six nominees.
