Construction Permit prices vary widely
The government's construction ambition means cash for the municipalities: a building permit is on average 10 percent more expensive this year than in 2021. The Eigen Huis Association calls on Minister De Jonge to make agreements with municipalities about the price of a building permit
Amsterdam
Eigen Huis, together with IGG Bouweconomie, looked at the price of a permit for a small renovation of 10,000 euros ex VAT, for example for a dormer window, and for a new-build home of 170,000 euros ex building land and VAT.
For the first time, a permit for minor renovations costs an average of more than 400 euros. But the differences are big: where a resident of The Hague only has to pay 121 euros, a builder in Veenendaal pays 992.33 euros - almost ten times as much.
The price differences are also enormous for new-build homes. For the same building permit, new-build buyers in Wormerland, Terschelling and Zeist pay up to more than 12,000 euros, while buyers in Weert, The Hague and Waddinxveen only pay around 2,000 euros.
In the municipality of Wormerland, the fees have even more than doubled. A correction, a spokesperson explains. "In order to cover the budget for 2022, it was necessary that, among other things, the rates for construction fees were made cost-effective. We have not charged enough for this for years and were therefore unable to achieve it financially."
And the North Holland municipality still contributes money, according to the spokesperson. By 2022, 87 percent of the costs will be covered.
In Putten the increase is more than 50 percent. And that is because the Gelderland municipality cannot find officials to process all applications.
"We are a small municipality, people are being moved away from here," says a spokesperson for responsible councilor Ewoud 't Jong. "And so we have not only asked retirees to come back, but also have to hire interim workers to remove the large workload. These are expensive, and our starting point is that the price for the permit must cover costs."
Point of concern
The result: anyone who wants to build a house in Putten now pays almost 5,000 euros for the permit alone. Last year that piece of paper only cost a little more than 3,000 euros. "These expensive fees are a point of concern," says the councilor's spokesperson. "But the amount is up to the municipal council. They can determine that the price no longer has to cover costs."
How is it possible that prices differ so much between municipalities? “A large municipality can work more efficiently than a small one, that plays a role. No profit is made on it. The price must cover costs, but each municipality makes its own calculation. One only includes the costs of the official, the other also those of his office and the reception."
The interest group is seriously concerned about next year. "If the new Environmental Act is introduced on January 1, 2023, private parties will test the quality of new homes during construction," says Cindy Kremer, director of the Eigen Huis Association.
Dates
"The costs, in addition to the municipality's fees, will be borne by the buyer. That is why we want binding agreements to be made quickly about how these costs can be calculated. If this does not happen, a new-build home will soon cost thousands of euros more due to the high costs of the new legislation, even before the first stone has been laid."
