Minister Hugo de Jonge (Spatial Planning) believes that he has not informed the Senate incorrectly, but that he 'went too short'. He wrote in May that the delivery of the Digital System Environment Act was on schedule, while his ministry knew this was not the case. This came to light at the beginning of August. "It would have been better if I had given you a more nuanced answer in this answer," De Jonge now writes. The Digital System is crucial for the implementation of the Environmental Act. A large part of the Senate is extremely critical of the intended implementation date of that law, January 1, 2023.
