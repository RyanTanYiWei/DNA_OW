ABSTRACT
Mobility
 The traveler of the future will no longer pay separately for the use of their own car or train. All modes of transportation are part of an integrated payment system, so travelers can seamlessly transfer from one mode of transportation to another.
To realize this transport model, a radical change in the law is required. All laws regarding transport, such as the Road Act, Rail Act and Taxi Act, must be replaced by one mobility law for all forms of transport.
This is what Minister Schultz van Haegen (Infrastructure and Environment, VVD) advocates to NRC. She sees a crucial task for her successor in removing barriers in legislation and regulations for future transport.
Schultz predicts that mobility will no longer be linked to one means of transport. “New technology is far too diffuse for that. Look at the flying car or manned drones coming. Our laws currently do not provide for this, for example when it comes to safety or taxes."
Schultz guided the Environmental Act through the House in 2016, which replaced 26 laws on spatial planning, the environment and nature. "It is a lot of work. But it was necessary, procedures and permits have now become much simpler. We must also do the same for mobility."
