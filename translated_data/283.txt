The Hague The introduction of the Environmental Act is again delayed. The Ministry of the Interior hopes to bring into force the law, which aims to bundle and simplify all kinds of laws and regulations in the field of spatial planning and the living environment, on July 1, 2022. Outgoing Minister Kajsa Ollongren writes to the House of Representatives that, among other things, more time is needed to get the ICT systems 'delivered, adjusted and working stably'.
