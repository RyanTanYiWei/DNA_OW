39
The administrators of Kaag and Braassem adopted 39 zoning plans in December alone. "Such a number is normally not reached in a whole year," the municipality reports on its website. Many zoning plans concern housing construction and that is a spearhead in the municipality. Councilor Yvonne Peters is therefore pleased that her officials worked hard to achieve a lot to put plans into action.
The cause of the wave at the end of 2023 was the new Environmental Act with different rules that came into effect on January 1. Applicants prefer to deal with the old, familiar rules.
