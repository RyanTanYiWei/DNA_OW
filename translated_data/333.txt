Franeker Waadhoeke must better protect monumental and iconic trees by putting them on a list. Trees that appear on the list may only be felled with a felling permit.
A motion to that effect was adopted by the city council on Thursday evening. The motion was submitted by SAM, Gemeentebelangen and ChristenUnie, a narrow majority in the council. FNP, CDA and VVD did not support the proposal.
The trees in Waadhoeke are currently insufficiently protected, according to the parties that submitted the motion. The council wants to record tree protection in the new Environmental Act, but the introduction of that law has been delayed and SAM, Municipal Interests and CU do not want to wait for that.
Councilor Jan Dijkstra was instructed to make an inventory of historic and iconic trees and to make their felling subject to a permit requirement.
