The municipality bans new intensive livestock farming, greenhouses and goat farms
Leeuwarden It is becoming easier for farmers in the southern part of the municipality of Leeuwarden to enter the tourism sector. At least, if the municipal council agrees with the new environmental plan for part of the former municipality of Boarnsterhim.
The plan anticipates the introduction of the Environmental Act and replaces the current zoning plans. It states, among other things, what is allowed and what is not allowed in which location, and for what whether or not a permit must be applied for.
With a permit, farmers would be allowed to place mobile homes, build recreational bungalows or set up a camping field for a maximum of 25 guests. They can even start a business at the company without a permit.
However, they are limited in developing new agricultural activities. New intensive livestock farming and the establishment of greenhouse complexes and goat farms are becoming taboo. Since the plan has not yet been adopted, current applications in this area are still being processed, such as those for a large goat farm in Reduzum.
The plan divides the southern part of the municipality into four area types, each with their own rules and conditions. The mentioned rules apply to the 'agricultural' type, which covers the area between Warstiens and Warten and the Hempensermeerpolder and Idaard and the part south of Reduzum, without the village of Jirnsum. The rules for farmers in the 'peat meadow' area type are stricter. Here, the municipality does not want to contribute to the expansion of stables and livestock, but does want to contribute to the development of more extensive and nature-inclusive forms of agriculture. For example, timber construction is permitted, provided it does not harm meadow birds. This concerns 24 farmers in the area between Wergea, Warten and the island of De Burd near Grou.
These proposals drew criticism from farmers' interest group LTO Noord. The question is whether these plans will go ahead, because the municipal council still has to express its wishes and reservations about this. The council could also replace the entire area type 'peat meadow' with the area type 'agricultural', as became clear during the discussion of the plan in the municipal council last night. The council will discuss this further on April 7.
The southern part of the municipality will be the first to work with the Environmental Act, which is expected to come into effect on January 1. In the rest of the municipality, the current guidelines will remain in force temporarily. If it works well in the south, the law will be gradually applied in the rest of the municipality. The entire municipality must work in accordance with the new law by January 1, 2030 at the latest.
