The Hague Five civil servants and self-employed people (self-employed) who work on the Environment Act from the Ministry of the Interior have been suspended or are at home sick.
They have been severely pressured and intimidated. They had to keep criticism of the Environmental Act to themselves, or portray developments too rosy. This is what the First Member of Parliament Saskia Kluit (GroenLinks) said when asked. The five reported to her.
Together with other Senate factions, she is not only very concerned about this, but she also wonders whether the information that the Senate has received so far about the Environmental Act is correct. Based on that information, the Senate will soon have to vote on the implementation date of the Environmental Act; which is being called the largest legislative exercise since the late 1940s. Part of the Senate fears that it will have to make a decision based on incorrect or incomplete information.
The Environmental Act bundles and simplifies all laws and regulations for the living environment and spatial planning. The introduction of the law has already been postponed several times. Minister Hugo de Jonge, as Minister for Spatial Planning responsible for the Environment Act, does not want any further delay.
However, the introduction of the law as of January 1, 2023 is in doubt. De Jonge wanted to publish the Environmental Act in the Staatsblad on July 1 at the latest, so that municipalities have sufficient preparation time. The chance that this will succeed has shrunk considerably now that the Senate wants an explanation first.
