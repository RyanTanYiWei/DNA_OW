Joure A third of residents with an idea for their environment would approach the municipality to seek cooperation. This is evident from a survey among the residents' panel of De Fryske Marren. The municipality uses the results when making policy for citizen and government participation. A quarter of residents would not approach the municipality with a plan, because they think that the municipality is not open to cooperation. 64 percent of the participants had never participated in a municipal project or initiative. The most common reason given is that they have never been asked to think or collaborate. 83 percent of participants think it is important that residents think about their own living environment.
Citizen participation plays an important role in the Environmental Act, which must come into effect next year. The law should simplify the rules regarding spatial planning and the living environment, with greater responsibility resting with municipalities.
