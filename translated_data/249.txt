Leiderdorp
PvdA and GroenLinks will participate in the municipal elections in Leiderdorp in March next year with a joint list. The members of both departments agreed to this new form of cooperation on Friday.
Since March, both parties have exchanged ideas about joint participation in the municipal elections. With a positive outcome, which was also embraced by the members. Party chairmen Bob Vastenhoud (GroenLinks) and Olaf McDaniel (PvdA) are pleased with the collaboration. They see working together towards the 2022 municipal elections as a logical next step. Vastenhoud: "The ideas of the two parties show many similarities. We have been increasingly seeking collaboration for years." McDaniel: "By joining forces we can put more energy into topics such as the new environmental law, the energy issue, housing shortage and youth care."
Both factions currently occupy three council seats, but do not have a seat in the council. Bob Vastenhoud: "If you combine those seats, you can take the lead in council formation sooner." Olaf McDaniel adds: "Previously, one of our parties was always left out, or - worse - both Together we will undoubtedly be better at making Leiderdorp more social and greener."
Merge
 The joint list of candidates does not mean that the two parties will merge. Whether this happens at a later stage partly depends on the choices made by the national PvdA and GroenLinks. The two House of Representatives factions are also currently seeking rapprochement to increase their influence in the political arena.
