Recently, former minister Cees Veerman and emeritus professor Louise Vet argued in this newspaper for a delta plan for agriculture, which should determine the limits for ammonia and nitrogen emissions in certain areas.

Groundbreaking for climate policy. But such a plan can only be implemented if there is a legal basis for it in addition to sufficient financial scope. If its introduction goes ahead, it will become the Environmental Act from 1 January 2022. But unfortunately for the climate goals, the law is not designed for that.

This deficiency is yet another objection to the Environmental Act. More and more scientists and planners are speaking out against it, and half of the municipalities do not want it. The law has no national control function, shifts national spatial issues to lower levels of government, limits participation opportunities, does not achieve the promised budget neutrality, is at odds with legal certainty and is built around an ICT system that has not wanted to work properly for years and that will cost billions.

The introduction of the law has been postponed several times since 2016, but after years of preparation, prestige counts; the Environmental Act is being pushed through despite all objections.

How many more objections are needed? Or will prestige remain more important than responsible policy even after Rutte III?
