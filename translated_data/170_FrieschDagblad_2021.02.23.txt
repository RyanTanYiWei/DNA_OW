Grou Agricultural organization LTO Noord is angry about the trial of an environmental plan that the municipality of Leeuwarden has drawn up for the area around Grou. The environmental plan, which was drawn up in the run-up to the introduction of the Environmental Act, proposes an expansion stop for 24 farms in the peat meadow area. The plan has yet to be finalized.
