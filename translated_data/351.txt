Zoeterwoud councilor Ton de Gans (CDA) will not return to the municipal executive after the 2022 municipal elections, should his party become part of it.
De Gans (49) was an alderman in Zoeterwoude for eight years. He previously served as a councilor for the CDA for four years. De Gans is the first deputy mayor and also has Spatial Development, Economy, Finance, the Energy Transition, Green Heart Policy and Waste in his portfolio.
"I have worked for our entrepreneurs and residents with great enthusiasm in recent years," says De Gans. “I have contributed to many projects, such as the housing projects on the Rijndijk and Zwethof. The introduction of the Environmental Act and municipal finances are also challenging tasks."
De Gans has no idea yet what he will do after his councilorship. "I will focus on that in the coming months," said the native of Lissen.
