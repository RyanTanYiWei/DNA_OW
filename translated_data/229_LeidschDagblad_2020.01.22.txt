  Leiden Nieuw Leids Bolwerk (NLB) wants to be able to formally participate in decisions on the plans for the development of an Energy Park around the power station on the Langegracht. The residents' initiative is therefore being transformed into an area council, complete with working groups and advisory councils. NLB board member Jos van Iersel announced this on Tuesday evening in the Nieuwe Energie building, where local residents were updated on the state of affairs. It is not a pie in the sky. Two years ago, local residents successfully opposed the plans on which the municipality was working with the MeyerBergman Heritage Group (known for the Amsterdam Westergasfabriek). The residents worked together with developers BPD, Steenvlinder and housing association De Sleutels. Recently, even MeyerBergman has joined in. The idea is that developers and the new area council would have separate positions at the negotiating table. Otherwise it becomes very complicated. The question remains whether and how such an area council can take legal shape, but the new Environmental Act, which is expected to come into effect in 2022, probably offers room for the ambitious experiment, according to the municipality. "We think this is certainly worth studying," says Simone Eeftink, municipal project leader for the Energy Park. The park should become a new Leiden district with diverse functions, around the power plant with its famous chimney. In the long term, the municipality hopes to be able to include the power plant itself in the plan.
