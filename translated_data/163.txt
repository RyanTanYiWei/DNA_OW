  Leiderdorp Only two parties in the Leiderdorp municipal council managed to find a use for the surplus of 1.2 million euros on the municipal profit account: VVD and GroenLinks. No other party independently saw a purpose for the money, but sided with one of the two parties.
After making an inventory of the wishes, GroenLinks still had 318 thousand euros left. VVD was more frugal and saved 838 thousand of the 1.2 million euros. GroenLinks argued for a game of 'art and culture' and one for innovation. This was criticized by the CDA. The ink that sealed the abolition of an earlier art pot was not yet dry when GroenLinks wanted to reintroduce it. That jar wasn't empty then and probably won't be empty now either. It was better to deposit the surplus in the general reserves and then take it out again, provided there are good plans. How high the amount in the art and innovation pot should be remained unclear. The party was more specific about the reserve for the energy transition: more than half a million. Sustainability councilor Willem Joosten (VVD) was not looking for that. He didn't have plans to match until next year. The VVD would like to spend 168 thousand euros on an Information Policy Plan and 150 thousand euros on the introduction of the Environmental Act. That plan was voted down with one vote.
