The Hague The Environmental Act, which came into effect on January 1, has not yet caused any major problems for provinces and municipalities. The introduction of the law was postponed for years, partly due to IT problems.
Provinces expect the number of (complex) applications under the law to increase in the coming months, after which it will only become clear whether everything is working properly.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, 27,557 requests were submitted to the digital counter in the first five weeks of 2024, mainly for permits and notifications. "The emergency team has not yet had to take action," said a spokesperson.
The Environmental Act bundles dozens of laws and regulations that regulate the spatial planning of the Netherlands. The law should make it easier for citizens and companies to apply for a permit for various matters, from a dormer window to the extraction of groundwater. This is possible within one digital system. Just before the introduction, several municipalities and provinces expressed concerns about the underlying technology. As a precaution, the province of Overijssel even set up a first aid team: First Aid for Environmental Law Problems.
