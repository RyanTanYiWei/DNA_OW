Noordwijk
The preliminary design of the new bus and bicycle bridge over the Ringvaart between Lisse and Lisserbroek is ready. This makes the fast bus connection between Noordwijk and Schiphol one step closer.
The bridge that is drawn directly next to the Lissese Fioretti College connects on the North Holland side of the water to a newly constructed bus lane to Nieuw-Vennep. This will soon create a fast connection that will also receive the designation of High-Quality Public Transport.
The new rapid bus connection has been talked about for years. The expectation was that the required infrastructure would be ready by the end of 2025. The question is whether that will really work. There may now be a preliminary design on the table, but there are still many reports to be written and procedures to be completed before the spa can be put into the ground. For example, new nitrogen calculations will continue in the coming months and ecological studies on bats and various bird species are planned.
All research must be completed well before the end of the year. If that deadline is not met, the permit application will fall under the new Environmental Act, which will in any case cause a lot of delays. If everything goes according to plan, the permit should be ready 'around the summer of 2024'.
