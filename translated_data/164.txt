To lead
 The Leiden Municipal Executive must annually inform the municipal council of everything that has been decided on the basis of the Environmental Act.
The law will be introduced in phases from January to 2032 and should be much simplified. But the law is so extensive that there is concern that it will actually lead to more red tape. In addition, municipal councils lose some responsibilities. In order to be able to keep an eye on whether everything is going well, the Leiden council decided on Thursday evening that it must receive an annual overview of all decisions.
The council also decided (with votes against from D66, CDA, VVD and SP) that it must be known when issuing emergency permits for temporary construction works if this is for longer than three years. This was against the wishes of B&W, who had wanted to retain a free hand for up to ten years.
