  Leiden What protection will valuable landscapes receive, how can the regional economy be boosted and where will the magnetic levitation track be located? The 'Regional Agenda Environmental Vision 2040' of ten municipalities in the region is ready. The document will be available for inspection from February 27 and everyone can have their say about it.
Just two more years and the new Environmental Act will come into effect. This will make many existing laws redundant. As a result, Dutch municipalities must draw up an environmental vision in which they include their existing policy for the living environment and outline how they see the future. The vision replaces current structural visions, parts of the nature vision, national and provincial water plans, traffic and transport plans and environmental policy plans.
Patchwork
Ten municipalities in this region (Leiden, Leiderdorp, Katwijk, Kaag en Braassem, Noordwijk, Oegstgeest, Voorschoten, Teylingen, Zoeterwoude and Wassenaar) decided to collaborate. They first made a regional agenda. This must form a basis for the local environmental visions. This is to prevent a patchwork of conflicting future plans from arising, but also from the idea that it is wise to work together on major issues such as land subsidence, expanding environmentally friendly energy extraction and competition with other regions. Small villages, urban areas, knowledge-intensive activities, high-tech, city life and valuable landscapes... together they have just about everything, the ten partners believe.
 Regional agenda for the future
