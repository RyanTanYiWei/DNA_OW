  Katwijk Katwijk wants to stop providing archaeological advice on monument care to municipalities in the Dune and Bulb Region.
The municipality of Teylingen - and officially also Lisse and Hillegom - and Noordwijk have switched to the Environment Agency. This leaves Noordwijkerhout and for Katwijk it is not profitable to provide advice to one municipality. The advice from the Environmental Service is provided by Erfgoed Leiden en Omstreek. Katwijk is discussing a possible collaboration and also wants to find out how municipal archeology policy can be incorporated into the future Environmental Act. "In this context, we also want to jointly find a solution to the ongoing discussion with interest party LTO-Noord about the disruption problems in the Dune and Bulb Region," B and W wrote to the council members.
