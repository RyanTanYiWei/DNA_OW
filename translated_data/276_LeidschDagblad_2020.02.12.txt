  The Hague The Senate has given the green light to the Environmental Act. This is a huge operation to simplify regulations regarding spatial planning and the living environment. It must ensure that citizens and companies receive permits more quickly, for example for renovations.
The Environmental Act has regularly come under fire recently. Critics fear legal chaos and high costs. It would also not make it any clearer. There are also concerns about digitalization. The bill merges 26 laws. It is the largest change in the law since 1848. The law was originally scheduled to come into effect in 2018, but that date was not met. The government has released 90 million euros for the introduction.
