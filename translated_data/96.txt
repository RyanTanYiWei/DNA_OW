 Hazerswoude/Koudekerk The municipality of Alphen is blocking new developments in the rural areas of Hazerswoude and Koudekerk. Growers, farmers and other entrepreneurs in both villages are calling for a new zoning plan, with rules about spatial options.
The fact that councilor Gerard van As (Nieuw Elan) is abandoning a new zoning plan is not well received by farmers. The alternative, a temporary management regulation with a conservative content, is in their view an 'unfortunate and unnecessary' stopgap. According to agricultural organization LTO Noord, Alphen is 'lax' by waiting so long with new rules. “It cannot be the case that entrepreneurs become the victims of your procrastination,” said spokesman Bert Roest. “There must be a plan that entrepreneurs can get started with quickly and easily.” According to René van der Sijs, a Hazerswoud advisor to many growers, the municipality is 'locking down' the rural area. "While there are all positive developments, such as discussions about restructuring horticulture." The management regulation must follow the zoning plan for the Rijnwoude Country Area from 2004, which has been 'out of date' for two years. According to Van As, the temporary management regulation is pending the new Environmental Act, which will come into effect in 2018. "Then we want to draw up uniform rules for the entire rural area of ​​Alphen."
