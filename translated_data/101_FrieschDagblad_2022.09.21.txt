Highlight: Beetsterzwaag The municipality of Opsterland has sufficient money to realize the ambitions of the Mei-inoar foarút coalition agreement in 2023. This is evident from the 2023 budget, which the municipal council will discuss on November 7.
Body


To spare residents, B and W have chosen not to increase the total costs of the sewerage tax and waste tax in 2023. In this way, the municipality contributes to keeping the ever-increasing costs of living manageable.
Together with the council and residents, the municipality will work on the introduction of the Environmental Act, and further steps will be taken towards an energy-neutral Opsterland. The municipality also continues to provide support to low-income residents.
The government is going to change the distribution of the money among the municipalities. Opsterland is already taking into account that it will receive five million euros less in 2026. This means that the financial situation after 2025 is uncertain.
Other costs that are difficult to estimate are those of refugee shelter and the corona pandemic. No amounts have been included in the budget for this.
