Wolvega In the spring, things still looked gloomy for the municipality of Weststellingwerf. But thanks to more government money, the council can adjust a deficit of 2.2 million euros in the 2022 budget to a surplus of 100,000 euros.
Councilor Jack Jongebloed is happy with the extra government money for youth and WMO, but does not want to celebrate too early. “We live in uncertain times and the municipality will have a lot to do in the coming years. Just think of the Environmental Act and any actions under the climate agreement."
The council promises that housing costs for residents of Weststellingwerf will only increase slightly. The sewerage tax will increase slightly and the waste tax rate will remain the same in the coming year.
The municipality also continues to invest in long-term projects, such as the approach to the center of Wolvega, the cycle path along De Lende, the redesign of the Steenwijkerweg in De Blesse and the Lycklamaweg in Wolvega.
