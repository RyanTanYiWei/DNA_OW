  Zoeterwoude What will happen in Zoeterwoude? With that question in mind, the municipality moved into the rural area last year. Residents and farmers were asked to think about the future of their municipality. This all has to do with the new environmental plan for the area. Various questions were asked to those involved. If the number of farms decreases, can housing be replaced? Should the municipality strictly adhere to the maximum size of buildings in the rural area, or could that policy be more relaxed? Is tranquility important, or is tourism important? Should agriculture win over nature? Next Thursday there will be a debate evening on the subject in café De Meester from 8 p.m., where the different views will be discussed. The environmental plan will be the successor to the zoning plan and is part of the environmental law. Thanks to the Environmental Act, it will soon no longer be necessary to apply for permits at different counters for a building plan, for example. The idea is that everything can be arranged centrally in a very clear manner. Photo LD
