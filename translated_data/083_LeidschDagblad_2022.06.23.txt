 A new team of aldermen will be at the helm in Kaag en Braassem. The new council was installed on Wednesday evening during a festive extra council meeting.
Yvonne Peters remains a councilor for the VVD, the other three faces are new. D66 nominates Nick van Egmond (right in the photo) for the alderman post and PRO Kaag en Braassem nominates Dolf Kistemaker (left in the photo) and Gerben van Duin.
Van Egmond, the current party leader of D66, will be given the portfolios of Finance, Education and Participation, among other things. Peters, now also a councilor on behalf of VVD, will be given, among other things, the Spatial Planning and Land Affairs portfolios during this term. Kistemaker, councilor for PRO Kaag and Braassem, will be given the portfolios of Housing, Environmental Vision/Environmental Act and Mobility, among other things. Finally, Van Duin, who was an alderman in Nieuwkoop until last week, will be given the Social Domain portfolio, among other things.
Together for Kaag en Braassem, the previous council provided an alderman, but has made way for PRO Kaag en Braassem. The party voted against the new council on Wednesday, just like the CDA.
The council also said goodbye to two council members at this meeting: Petra van der Wereld and Inge van der Meer are both leaving the political scene of the municipality of Kaag en Braassem.
