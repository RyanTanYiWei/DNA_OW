To lead
The municipality must be more flexible with sports clubs that are trying to increase the number of athletes. At least that is what VVD and CDA would like to see and they have asked the mayor and aldermen if they see an opportunity to do so.
The two parties read in this newspaper about the problems that the Stevenshof tennis club is experiencing. The club wants to sacrifice a tennis court for padel courts, in the hope of boosting membership numbers with the popular sport, but the request has already been rejected several times.
The last time because the municipality made a mistake in the zoning plan. It incorrectly states that 'sports and recreation' are not permitted at that location. The municipality also recognizes this mistake and has now announced that it will correct this when the new Environmental Act comes into force (expected in January) if zoning plans are changed into 'environmental plans'.
VVD and CDA think it is a strange thing. Just like the club, the municipality would like to get as many Stevenshoffers as possible into sports, so why make it so difficult? They also wonder whether TV Stevenshof might not be the only one. "To what extent are there comparable procedures by sports clubs to make their sports club more attractive, whereby the zoning plan also creates barriers? Does the council see opportunities to offer sports clubs more room for such requests?''
