Investigated citizen involvement in spatial policy
Assen The Province of Fryslân must establish a citizen participation policy in the run-up to the upcoming Environmental Act. The Northern Audit Chamber advises this in its report 'Room for input', presented yesterday, which examined the involvement of citizens in spatial policy in the three northern provinces.
The Environmental Act, which will come into effect in 2022, aims to involve citizens in spatial decisions at an early stage, but the province has not yet regulated such a policy. "Ideally, as soon as a plan is on the table, you should ensure that residents involved are heard and can participate," says chairman Anneke Beukers of the Northern Audit Chamber. "That can prevent a lot of misery later in the formal consultation process."
The report describes, among other things, how the province learned wise lessons from the upgrade project of the N381 into a motorway. The province had initially not counted on citizen participation in 2006 and thought it could resolve the matter with a few information evenings, but encountered great resistance from local residents.
As a result, the decision-making process regarding the road doubling of the N381 section between Donkerbroek and Oosterwolde had to be redone. Residents and village interests could now participate in decisions about the plans, which led to changes in the design, such as the construction of a bicycle tunnel and an ecological bridge.
"The province then recovered well and that is commendable," says Beukers. "You learn from it as a government and you restore confidence among citizens."
The experiences with the N381 project led to the population being more actively involved in subsequent major infrastructure projects, such as the Centrale As (N356), De Skieding (N358), the N31 along Harlingen and the Joure junction.
Living room conversation
A survey conducted by the Frisian Social Planning Office for the report among approximately 2,400 respondents shows that almost 80 percent of Frisian citizens want to be involved in decision-making about their living environment. However, most of them want to leave the decision-making power with the government. Nearly two-thirds of respondents indicate that they have participated in spatial processes. Personal forms of participation such as the design studio (score 8.1) and the living room conversation (7.8) are most appreciated.
Participants in drop-in evenings often find it unclear what will be done with the results of such an evening. People are least satisfied with the legal means of submitting a view or objection. That only scores a 5.5.
The province learned valuable lessons from the N381 project, according to the Court of Audit
