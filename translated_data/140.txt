The introduction of the Environmental Act will be postponed again by six months. Minister De Jonge (Spatial Planning) reports to the House of Representatives that the law must come into effect on January 1, 2024. This is the fifth time that the introduction of the law, which was already adopted in 2016, has been postponed.
The Environmental Act must bundle dozens of laws and regulations for spatial planning. The law should make it easier to obtain a building permit, for example. With this law, municipalities will be able to do this in the future via a digital counter.
The intention was that the law would come into effect last New Year, but the Senate did not agree to this. The computer system required by the law was not secure or stable enough for a long time. The technology is now in order, the Ministry of the Interior reports. Even now, the Senate still has to agree to the introduction as of January 1.
The delay is already costing more than the originally estimated costs (more than 1.3 billion euros) for the project.
