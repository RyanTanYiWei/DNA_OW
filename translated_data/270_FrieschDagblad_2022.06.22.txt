Highlight: The Hague Although the Senate wants to make a provisional decision on the Environmental Act before the summer, it still wants to be able to pull the emergency brake in the autumn. It therefore remains uncertain whether the law will come into effect on January 1.
Body


The introduction of the law has already been postponed five times before
Before the summer recess, the Senate will vote on the implementation date of 2023, as agreed in a consultation with Minister Hugo de Jonge (Spatial Planning). If a majority then agrees, it will not be a resounding yes, but a 'yes, provided'. Only when the ICT Assessment Advisory Board decides in the autumn that it is responsible to introduce the law on January 1, because the digital system that is crucial to the law works properly, will the Senate give its final approval. Without the green light from the advisory board, the introduction should be postponed, the Senate believes.
The Environmental Act bundles all laws and regulations in the field of spatial planning, making it easier to apply for a permit and to grant it more quickly.
De Jonge had hoped to receive a definitive yes from the Senate before the summer, so that the introduction date would be fixed. De Jonge can go along with the Senate's desired emergency brake. A definitive yes must come in October, he emphasized. The introduction of the law has already been postponed five times before.
