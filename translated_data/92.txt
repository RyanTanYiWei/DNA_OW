Joure The council can include rules for wood burning in the environmental plan, in which municipalities lay down all kinds of plans for the living environment. The council of De Fryske Marren wrote this to the GroenLinks faction, which asked questions in response to new RIVM data about the particulate matter emissions from wood stoves.
According to the institute, private stoves contribute 23 percent to particulate matter emissions in the Netherlands, instead of the almost 10 percent previously assumed. The faction wanted to know whether the new data prompted an investigation in the municipality. The council points out that the subject is national and that research at municipal level is not necessary. The municipality can now only check things such as the chimney height. The Environmental Act that will come into effect next year provides scope for new rules. The municipality subsidizes a measurement project by the University of Groningen, among others, in which citizens can use a particulate matter meter to investigate and report the air quality in their environment.
