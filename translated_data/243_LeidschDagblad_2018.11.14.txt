  Leiden Student Loesanne van der Geest from Leiden University of Applied Sciences has won the 2018 HBO graduation prize from VVM Netwerk for environmental professionals.
She wrote her graduation thesis about the Rijnhaven-Oost area in Alphen aan den Rijn. The municipality is experimenting here with the new Environmental Act, which will officially come into effect in 2021. Alphen wants to transform Rijnhaven Oost into a mixed urban area. Housing, businesses and recreation must coexist and the area must become attractive for all users, existing and new. This is difficult with the current legislation, but Van der Geest showed that the new law does make mixing of functions possible.
