  The Hague According to the province of South Holland, the Environmental Act, which is expected to come into effect in 2021, poses a risk to the regional coherence of construction projects. Partly for this reason she recently published the book 'Power of regional design'.
The new law makes planning and executing (construction) projects simpler. The province is not against this, but it advocates not losing sight of an overarching vision. In the book, the province looks back on a quarter of a century of 'shaping South Holland', where such a larger overview always formed an underlying guideline - emphatically not an imposed assignment - for designers and developers. According to the province, it is a method that helps forge partnerships, bundle financial flows and make spatial challenges visible. For example, the book includes the Katwijk coastal work, which is part of the broader task for coastal reinforcement until 2050. The book also contains projects on and along the A4, which as such forms a 'region' as a connection between economic centers. What happens in those centers has consequences for the highway and vice versa. The three authors (Francisco Colombo, Jeroen van Schaick and Peter Paul Witsen) describe the origin and development of these types of projects.
The book was published by De Nieuwe Haagsche and costs 27.95 euros. ISBN: 978-94-6010-076-5.
