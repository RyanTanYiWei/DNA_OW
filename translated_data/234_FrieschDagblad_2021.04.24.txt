The Hague Once again there are delays for the Environmental Act, which aims to simplify a series of rules and laws for spatial planning and the living environment. It must ensure faster procedures, so that, for example, permits can be granted more quickly. But there are still problems with the introduction of the digital systems.
Minister Kajsa Ollongren (Home Affairs) is therefore considering introducing the law four or six months later. The intention was for the law to come into effect on January 1. It has already been postponed a few times; The original plan was for the Environmental Act to come into effect in 2018.
Ollongren writes to the House that after consultation with provinces, municipalities and water boards, she has found 'that additional time is needed to reach a final decision on the date on which the Environmental Act can responsibly come into effect'. A poll in February already showed that more than one in three councilors wanted to postpone the introduction.
The introduction of the extensive law is also a costly affair. According to a study by consultancy firm KPMG, it will cost governments 1.3 to 1.9 billion euros.
