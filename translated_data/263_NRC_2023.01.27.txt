The introduction of the Environmental Act has been postponed for the fifth time. Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Housing and Spatial Planning, CDA) wrote on Thursday that the law must now come into force on January 1, 2024, six months later than the date decided last October. The Environmental Act should simplify spatial planning procedures in the Netherlands considerably, but the development of suitable software in particular poses a number of problems. The major cities already called at the end of last year to postpone the introduction of the law, because they need a period of six months to be prepared for the introduction of the law. (NRC)
