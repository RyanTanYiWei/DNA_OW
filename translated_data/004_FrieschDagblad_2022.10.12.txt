Highlight: The Hague Whether or not to introduce the Environmental Act as of January 1, 2023 is a 'dilemma', the ICT Assessment Advisory Board states in an advice to the Senate.
Body


According to the council, there are still 'significant limitations' in 'the current state of the Digital System Environmental Act' (DSO) that entail risks if the introduction per
January 1st.
The DSO supports the implementation of the new Environmental Act. This law should combine dozens of laws and regulations that currently apply regarding the living environment, so that it becomes easier to grant permits. But major problems can arise with the granting of building permits, for example, if the DSO does not work properly. Experts previously expressed their concerns about this if the new law came into effect on January 1.
It is possible to aim for
January 1, but then 'maximum efforts' are needed to limit risks. The advisory board recognizes that there is little time left for this. Another option is a postponement of, for example, six months. This gives room for a 'fundamental reorientation'.
The introduction of the Environmental Act was initially planned for
January 1, 2018, but has already been postponed several times. In the coming weeks, the Senate will debate the introduction of the law.
