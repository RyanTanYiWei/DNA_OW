The Environmental Service will have more tasks
Grou The costs of the Fryske Utfieringstsjinst Miljeu en Omjouwing (FUMO) will increase next year by more than five hundred thousand euros. This is evident from the 2022 budget of the service that, among other things, monitors compliance with environmental regulations for the eighteen Frisian municipalities and the provincial government.
The cost increase is related to a larger range of tasks, preparing for the new Environmental Act and improving the digital security of the organization based in Grou. The FUMO has budgeted 16.7 million euros in expenditure for next year.
The service is funded by the province and the municipalities. However, the cost increase does not mean a cost increase for all participants. Following comments from last year, the funding has been distributed more evenly. This works out slightly more favorably for Leeuwarden, among other things. That municipality will spend about 84,000 euros less next year.
After the province of Fryslân, the municipality of Terschelling is the government body that takes on the most tasks from the FUMO. For example, FUMO also carries out supervisory tasks for the island surrounding construction and demolition, so-called BRIKS tasks that other municipalities arrange themselves. Due to the costs, Terschelling is considering no longer outsourcing these tasks to FUMO. A decision on this is expected to be made this spring.
