Highlight: Special buildings in Achtkarspelen are in danger of being demolished because they are not protected. The Hûs en Hiem design committee believes that the municipality should designate municipal monuments.
Body


Achtkarspelen has 52 national monuments. In addition, other buildings are also interesting locally, but they never make it to the national list.
It was previously mapped out how many homes and other buildings could be included on the list. This yielded 450 addresses. But that inventory has not led to official protection. A number of buildings have now been demolished, de Hûs and Hiem note with some frustration.
The case has been going on in Achtkarspelen for a long time. In 2010, a former doctor's home in Surhuisterveen was demolished to make way for new construction. A petition against this had no effect, because there was no protection. The new environmental law does offer an opportunity to anchor the 'dowry', the aesthetic committee tips.
Of the Frisian municipalities, only De Fryske Marren, Harlingen, Heerenveen, Leeuwarden, Súdwest-Fryslân, Smallingerland and Oost- en Weststellingwerf have their own monument list.
