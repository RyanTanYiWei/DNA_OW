The Heerenveen municipal council recently gave the green light for the arrival of a residential care complex in the Moscowpleats in Katlijk. The council has changed the destination from 'residential purposes' to 'social facilities'. Completely legitimate according to the Spatial Planning Act (Wro). The FNP was the only party to vote against this proposal. Our reason: socio-spatial arguments. There was too much resistance and too little support within the village and among local residents. According to the FNP, a plan cannot be approved just because it falls within the spatial frameworks of existing laws, while the negative social impact is too great.
When a project like the Moscowpleats is started, local residents have a feeling about it. This can be both positive and negative. People look at what the consequences of plans are for their well-being and enjoyment of life and that of their neighbors and fellow villagers. This goes beyond spatial frameworks. It concerns matters such as support, social cohesion and the feeling of safety, privacy, nuisance and quality of life. I call these the social spatial arguments. And these arguments should be given a more important place in spatial decision-making.
Involved, honest and open
Social spatial arguments of local residents and stakeholders are easy to map. Initiators: ensure that they are properly involved in spatial plans from the start. Be honest and open about new plans. Organize meetings with local residents at an early stage. Listen to local residents. Give them a platform. And be clear about how their input is included in the plans. Ultimately, participation is not about being right. It is about looking together at the good and less good sides of plans, at possibilities and objections. When everyone feels heard and known in new plans, understanding and support are created. Even when the outcome is not entirely what someone wants.
Unfortunately, practice appears to be more difficult. In the three years that I have been a councilor, I have seen too often that the neighborhood, district and local residents were not properly taken into account. The result: lack of support in the neighborhood and angry and disappointed local residents. And this is a shame. In my opinion, the feelings of local residents are very important. After all, their immediate living environment is affected. Initiators often seem to be insufficiently aware of this.
But sometimes things go well. An example that will always stay with me comes from Utrecht, where I was once a party member. A care provider had plans for independent living units for young adults with social problems in a regular residential area. A form of assisted living. The entire neighborhood stood on its hind legs. Why? Fear of the unknown. A few information evenings later, during which there was considerable discussion, the air was cleared. The neighborhood knew what the plans really entailed and agreed with them. And the initiator made a number of commitments to the neighborhood to address concerns. The objections had thus become manageable.
Strangely enough, initiators seem to be insufficiently aware of the added value of participation. Local residents and local organizations often have something to say and often come up with good ideas. A few years ago this was clearly evident from the Rijkswaterstaat report on the added value of participation in infrastructure projects. And last week we saw this even closer to home: the participation process for the Heerenveen-Oranjewoud exit has led to a safe traffic solution that all parties agreed with.
No room in the law
But why does involving local residents and stakeholders so often go wrong? This is mainly due to the current spatial frameworks, the Spatial Planning Act. Unfortunately, social spatial arguments are not included in this. The Wro only provides for spatial assessments such as air quality, water and external safety. As council members, we are quite powerless in that respect if plans are spatially correct but there is a lack of support or participation. What is possible, and what we do every time, is to insist that participation must be improved. And sometimes, as in the case of the Moscow Pleats, the socio-spatial arguments weigh more heavily than the spatial substantiation.
Fortunately, a lot will change in this area when the new Environmental Act comes into effect, probably on January 1, 2022. In this new law, local residents and stakeholders do get the voice they deserve. 'Participation' and 'support' will become an important part of the spatial assessment framework. Whether it concerns the installation of a large extension to a house, the establishment of a healthcare complex or the redesign of a roundabout, the initiators must demonstrate that they have sufficiently included those directly involved in the process.
The council has a significant influence on the frameworks that are provided in advance regarding participation. And how much that participation counts in the final decision. Social spatial arguments will finally be given the full place they deserve within spatial decision-making. A major benefit for local residents and stakeholders.
Until the new Environmental Act comes into effect, the FNP will continue to keep a close eye on the socio-spatial side of spatial decision-making and will continue to emphasize the importance of good participation. We continue to advocate for local residents and stakeholders.
