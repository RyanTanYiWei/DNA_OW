Rotterdam
A change in the law is needed to ensure a healthier food supply in Rotterdam. Municipalities do not have enough resources to do this themselves.
Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Ede have noted this and research from the University of Amsterdam (UvA) confirms this picture. That is why an urgent letter has been sent to the responsible State Secretary Paul Blokhuis (Public Health).
Rotterdam health councilor Sven de Langen has been advocating for a better distribution of food supply in the Maasstad for some time. More than a year ago he announced the battle with fast food chains that dominate the street scene.
It is easier to buy a hamburger in the city center than an apple, he noted angrily. The municipality would take action through the new Environmental Act, so that the number of hamburger shops could be phased out. However, municipalities do not appear to have that option at all.
