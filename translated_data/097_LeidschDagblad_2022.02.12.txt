Katwijk
The municipality of Katwijk will have a measuring point for aircraft noise in three places. These should form a baseline measurement to determine whether nuisance will increase after the new airspace division.
"These measuring points are indispensable to keep it under control," responds councilor Geert Diemer of the coalition party Municipal Interests, who has been working on this for four years. “The new Environmental Act contains a standard for aircraft noise. With the help of these measurements, residents can tell the judge: this must be enforced."
Neighboring municipalities such as Noordwijk, Teylingen, Lisse and Leiden already have such measuring points. Katwijk is very late, but better late than never, Diemer emphasizes. The experienced councilor speaks of 'a fantastic farewell gift'. “Our own councilor Rien Nagtegaal has been strongly behind it. He also sees the threat.”
For the three measuring points, Katwijk takes out a subscription of 12,150 euros per year with the specialized company Sensornet. It is not yet known exactly where in the municipality they will be located. According to Diemer, the Katwijk Rijnsoever district, the Rijnsburg districts Frederiksoord and Kleipetten and the village of Valkenburg are the most obvious. "That's where most of the complaints come from."
