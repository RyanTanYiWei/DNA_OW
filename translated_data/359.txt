The new cabinet wants an integrated solution for Schiphol 'that offers certainty and perspective for both Schiphol's hub function and the airport's surroundings'. Residents of Schiphol have been calling for a more balanced course for aviation for some time.
Because the interests of local residents have not been sufficiently taken into account in the Schiphol policy, a huge breach of trust has occurred. Nuisance-reducing measures have not adequately compensated for the disadvantages of growth. The only cure is to fly less. This can be done without endangering the international accessibility of our country and also serves other goals such as housing construction and sustainability. That is why there must be a new definition of environmental quality, network quality and legal protection. The 'Citizen's Vision Schiphol' fleshes this out in concrete terms.
The aviation policy of recent years has not led to the promised 'development in balance with the environment'. Future policy with the 'growth earnings model' will not achieve this either. It is a misconception that the disadvantages of aviation growth can be removed with nuisance-reducing measures. After all, the number of people seriously inconvenienced has not decreased as agreed, but increased by half. This will be made even worse by the enormous housing construction challenge.
Moreover, the nuisance per person has also increased. Relocation of routes, operational measures and quieter and cleaner aircraft have not been able to prevent a permanent attack on health and damage to the living environment in large areas near the airport and under flight routes.
Schiphol's noise calculations have been incorrect for years. The Environmental Impact Assessment Committee has shown in its advice on the Schiphol Airport Traffic Decree that the New Standards and Enforcement System does not reduce nuisance. At most, it leads to the displacement and concentration of nuisance, which on balance only increases the nuisance.
Noise pollution
That is why there must be a new standard for individual environmental quality: it is no longer the calculated number of people who experience annoyance that counts, but the actual measured noise load at a specific location. It then turns out that the limit of what the environment can tolerate has been amply exceeded, in total and locally. This much is clear: living and flying do not go together. That can also be solved, because Schiphol is far too loose.
Schiphol has grown rapidly in recent years with unnecessary flights for foreign transfers that do not benefit the Dutch economy. At the same time, the increase in nuisance has been obscured by not counting new people inconvenienced. Because reducing nuisance does not provide sufficient relief, the only solution is to fly less.
Achieving other goals such as sustainability and housing construction also requires this. Reducing emissions (CO2, nitrogen, ultrafine particles) is only possible with a significantly lower number of flights. According to various studies, an optimal Schiphol can accommodate a maximum of 350,000 flights. Abolition of the transfer model makes such a reduction possible without affecting our country's international connections.
The representation of the interests of those who experience the disadvantages of Schiphol, both individually and collectively, is poor. While every citizen can object to an adverse change in his environment on the ground (for example the construction of a cycle path next to his garden), this is not possible if Schiphol builds a highway in the air right above that same garden. There is a lack of individual legal protection and an appeal to the courts quickly becomes hopeless. Victims also come off badly if they want to collectively represent their interests. Participation and consultation are often without obligation and agreements are not enforceable. This is because aviation standards are too low or too vague, are still missing, are not monitored and are violated with impunity.
A special problem arises with the issue of housing and flying. With the entry into force of the Environmental Act, the implementation decree on noise from roads, railway lines and factories must be supplemented with aircraft noise. When these are added together, it becomes clear how bad the environmental noise is in total. Current local residents have known this for a long time from their own experience, but now it is also legally 'audible' that the standards have been widely exceeded. Because housing construction in the Randstad is therefore virtually impossible, there is a risk that the cause will not be addressed (fewer flights), but the consequences will be brushed away (lowering the standard). This is unheard of because the World Health Organization (WHO) has actually recommended tightening the aircraft nuisance standard.
Due to the political malaise in 2021, the Aviation Memorandum has been declared controversial, meaning that there is no political basis for aviation policy. This has aggravated the existing tolerance situation and also postponed the intended transformation of the Schiphol Environmental Council (ORS) into a Schiphol Social Council (MRS). A new administrative culture must put an end to this legal vacuum. With this in mind, the ORS residents' delegation has drawn up a 'Citizen's Vision Schiphol' as a concrete agenda for the new permanent Schiphol consultation.
