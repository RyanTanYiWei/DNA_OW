Land speculation is legal. There is no supervision.
The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), whose task is to protect consumers against extortionate policies and promises of sky-high returns, has been warning about the risks for years, but cannot intervene itself.
Due to a gray area in the law, the lands are not, strictly speaking, an 'investment object'. As a result, land dealers evade the licensing and prospectus requirements for investments and thus any interference from the AFM.
Nevertheless, the Amsterdam court opened the door to bringing land trading under the supervision of the AFM. In January, the judge ruled in the appeal of a case against land trader Groza from Budel. Groza won that case, but the judge stated that it 'appears to be an investment object'.
Professor of agricultural law Jeroen Rheinfeld sees another solution to put a stop to speculation. "In Germany, the government has the right of first purchase. In the past we also had that option here, but it was never implemented because it would go against free market forces." Such an initial purchase would ensure that a government can put a stop to unbridled speculation. However, the new Environmental Act does not provide for such a provision.
