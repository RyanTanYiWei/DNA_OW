The introduction of the Environmental Act has been postponed again. Outgoing Minister Kajsa Ollongren (Home Affairs, D66) wrote to the Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday that July 1, 2022 is the intended effective date. According to the minister, the delay is because more time is needed to get the ICT systems "working stably". The law should have come into effect years ago - the House of Representatives has already approved it, the Senate has almost agreed Ollongren writes that not "all parties" are ready for the law, which bundles thousands of legal articles and regulations. The new postponement of the law also has financial consequences. (NRC)
