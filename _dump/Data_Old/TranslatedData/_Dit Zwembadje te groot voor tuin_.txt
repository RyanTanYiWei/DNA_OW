DEVENTER - Children in the Deventer working-class district of Rode Dorp must quickly look for an alternative to the popular swimming pool in Landstraat. The municipality demands that the bath be removed tomorrow, much to the sadness and anger of the parents involved.
Wesley de Vries is disappointed. Together with his girlfriend Wendy Meijer, he is the driving force behind the water paradise, which was set up especially for their own offspring and neighborhood children. The bath was first on the sidewalk but, they thought, in good consultation with the municipality, was moved to two front gardens. Yesterday they were overwhelmed by a phone call from the official organization, which showed that no exception will be made for them. “They promised to enter into discussions with us and that is not happening.”
According to the municipality's spokesperson, Maarten Jan Stuurman, a permit must be applied for for a pool of such a size based on the Environmental Act. But even if this is done properly, the Municipal Executive will not issue it. “Because if something happens to the bath, an accident or whatever, the municipality is liable. Of course we don't want that," he emphasizes. The approval for installation in the front garden is outdated, the municipality says.
After measurements, the local government arrives at a volume of 15,000 liters of water, while residents keep it at approximately 10,600 liters.
De Vries, Meijer and their neighbors are not going to leave it at that and hope to find a lawyer who will assist them in a legal battle against the 'official flapping' by the municipality of Deventer.
