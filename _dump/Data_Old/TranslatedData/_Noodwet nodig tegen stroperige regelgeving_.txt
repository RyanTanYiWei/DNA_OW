Chairman of the trade association WoningbouwersNL, Mr Piet Adema, identifies exactly where the problem lies when it comes to the implementation of many (housing) construction plans (Tel. 5/7), says Rob Dommerholt.
Our government is saying all kinds of things about solving the housing crisis by providing for the construction of a million homes in the next ten years. That simply won't work because we in the Netherlands are entangled in our building and environmental regulations. We have recorded exactly what is and is not possible in terms of construction. To deviate from this - given the housing crisis - lengthy procedures must be completed. Many municipalities simply do not have the capacity or expertise for this. The desired restructuring of farms is also failing for this reason. The government wants to reorganize agricultural companies, but offers no prospects for farmers. Our daughter had to fight for three years for a new, tailor-made destination for her former agricultural company! In the intervening time, nothing was possible or allowed. That is not a perspective for all farmers who are now confronted with restructuring plans. The only option to provide for the various crisis situations that are now occurring in various policy areas is the rapid introduction of a general emergency law that (temporarily) lifts blocking regulations. This is also because the new Environmental Act has been postponed for the umpteenth time and will probably not be introduced on January 1, 2023.
Rob Dommerholt, Lemmer
