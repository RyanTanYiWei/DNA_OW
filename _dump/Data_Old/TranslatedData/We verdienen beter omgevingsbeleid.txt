Letter of the day
In the Volkskrant of August 2. the column by Floortje Smit (Housing, page 2) and articles by Marcel van Lieshout (Climate Rules, page 2), Mac van Dinther and Pieter Hotse Smit (Organic Farmers, pages 13-15) made it clear for the umpteenth time that environmental policy in the Netherlands is completely bankrupt.

It is deeply shameful how the Dutch government keeps trying to avoid its European responsibilities with sneaky cleverness and legal stupidity, and in fact also abandons its own citizens.

With the abolition of the classic Housing, Spatial Planning and Environmental Management in 2010, the choice for 'decentralized, unless' and 'opportunities for economic development' and laws that limit opportunities for participation, the living environment of the Dutch citizen has been completely handed over to the public. free market. This has led to European reprimands, the nitrogen drama, extreme housing shortages, uncontrolled project development, attacks on the residential environment with wind farms, solar farms, distribution boxes and aircraft noise, to the fragmentation of nature and landscape and ultimately to the black hole in which farming has ended up.

And now our national government is about to introduce a controversial Environmental Act that will perpetuate this policy for years to come. How long will the Netherlands tolerate this neoliberal environmental policy? Our country deserves better.
