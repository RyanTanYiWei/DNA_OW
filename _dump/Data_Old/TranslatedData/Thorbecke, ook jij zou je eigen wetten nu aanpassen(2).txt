ABSTRACT
How can you give space to differences and still preserve the unity of the country, asks Kajsa Ollongren in her Thorbecke lecture.
COMPLETE TEXT:
Dear Sir Thorbecke, or may I write: Dear Rudolph?
I'm writing to you because I want to share something with you. And I think I can call you Rudolph, because ... yes, it has all become a bit more informal over time. And there is also a bust of you in my office, right behind me. You look over my shoulder every day. You have a new biography out. What remains after reading this monumental work is the image of an outsider who managed to develop into the most powerful man in the Netherlands, and who subsequently succeeded in implementing numerous lasting reforms. [...] The Netherlands is still founded on your constitution. On your three-tiered governance model: central government, provinces, municipalities.
You may think: that sounds like little has changed. Well... For starters, there are more of us. Almost six, seven times as much as in your time. From 2.5 to about 17 million people. You know the horse tram. [...] You know the telegram. If my sons asked what that was, I'd say: an email on a bicycle. Let's say an email is a telegram traveling at the speed of light. [...] But your Constitution still stands proud. Just like your electoral law, your Province Act and your Municipal Act. The fact that you usually wrote these laws yourself still amazes friend and foe.
“Every epoch has its own principle of movement; if it is left to sleep, confusion of movement will arise in the next period. Steady succession is not maintained by unemployment, but by steady creation.”
You said it in so many words: public administration must move with the times, otherwise it will no longer function properly.
The first half of your nineteenth century was a time of gloom. The war with Belgium had cost a lot of money. There was a threat of state bankruptcy. The potato blight was rampant. There were uprisings in various countries. Revolutions. There were even calls for the Netherlands to join Germany. In a table speech you also doubted the ability of the Netherlands to survive on its own strength: "Does the nation still have the strength and character that it deserves to be independent more than in name?"
Perhaps some people - because you were half-German yourself, your wife was German, and you were very influenced by German culture - had expected otherwise, but you, Rudolph, still chose independence from the Netherlands. You looked for a solution in a new system of government that would provide room for popular participation. Otherwise the same thing could happen here in the Netherlands as in surrounding countries.
You wanted to create "life and growth". Involve people in clear, regular public administration. Stimulate the "productive power of the nation". Removing local duties and tolls that hindered trade. You intervened in outdated structures and emancipated people who were not being addressed. Jews. Catholics. And this is against the dominant interests of the establishment. In your words: "It is not an old society that preserves, it is a new one that demands completion."
You founded secondary schools throughout the country, so that middle-class boys were prepared for work in 'industrial society'. You improved the infrastructure with the North Sea Canal and expansion of the railways. You improved poor relief, because you believed that a civilized state was obliged to care for its poor itself. You ensured that Aletta Jacobs, the first woman, could study medicine at the University of Groningen.
And you put an end to the patchwork of cities, villages, crafts, lordships, lordships. All with their own rights. Everyone was given the same status as a municipality. With the same structure, the same administrative bodies, the same procedures, the same autonomy. "We are going to do a great and lasting benefit to the country" - and history proved you right.
Dear Rudolph, The Netherlands in 2018 is a country of unprecedented prosperity. Of progress, opportunities and mobility. One of the freest, safest and most prosperous countries in the world. A country where you can be who you are, regardless of your religion, your origin or your sexual orientation. Where young people enjoy new opportunities and girls are now in the majority at our universities.[...]
Yet, just like in your time, there is unease about the way the country is being governed. [...] The dividing lines are increasing. Between highly educated hipsters in urban coffee shops and aging people in the countryside. Between social trust and distrust. Between people who feel like the world is their oyster. And who have the feeling that they are always in the corner where the blows fall.
While the world has become a large playground for some, their own environment is of greater significance for others. Your own neighborhood. The very own Mienskip. Your own square. [...] A father in Amsterdam will wonder whether his daughter will still be able to find affordable housing in the city. A mother in the Achterhoek will wonder whether her son will ever sell his home. A director of a primary school in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen will wonder whether he can still keep his school open. A teacher in The Hague asks whether she can give every child enough attention in her overcrowded classroom.
The dividing lines are increasing, while national and municipal boundaries are blurring. To achieve coherent policy in your hometown of Zwolle, twenty municipalities and four provinces are now joining forces. I wonder out loud what you think this should mean for the organization and functioning of public administration. [...] The issue of our time is how to give space to this difference and at the same time preserve unity in the Netherlands. Ensuring that everyone gets his or her opportunities, that effort is rewarded, that everyone receives the right care and can live well.
I'm becoming convinced that you would be in favor of exercise. Because wasn't it you who coined the term "organic polity"? [...] You would adapt your governance model to what the times require. [...] You said yourself: "The world is moving forward, and I wished to move forward with her."
So why say no to the large municipalities that want to carry out more tasks themselves? If that helps the daughter of that concerned father in Amsterdam find a home... Or no to a province like Zeeland that wants to carry out municipal tasks if that director can keep his primary school open? Why say no to municipalities that want to collaborate with each other in new concepts such as a 'federation municipality'? If that - to quote you - stimulates "the productive power of the nation"? [...] And why - if some municipalities do take on more tasks - is actually a 'no' to the possibility of municipalities taking on more of their own to have a board set up, to decide for themselves how many councilors they want, or to hold interim municipal elections?
These are solutions that conflict with our legal frameworks. And I now say 'yes' to those solutions. Yes, with a big proviso. The only conditions I impose are those of the essential edges of the playing field of democracy and the rule of law. Such as: the autonomy of municipalities; the democratic accountability of governance; separation between executive and supervisory powers; the political responsibility of the council for their civil servants; and the requirements we impose on directors in the areas of integrity and incompatibility of functions.
Dear Rudolph, I want a Netherlands in which everyone has the same opportunities. Regardless of whether you grow up in Aalten, Appelscha or Amsterdam. In the interest of this unity, difference is necessary. And isn't that where our historical strength lies? Doesn't that also contain our identity?
The reason Descartes gave for his move to the Netherlands was that the climate was "better for thinking", and he referred to our education. Feeling at home together in difference.
We found unity in the fight against water, but left the headstrong cities of the seventeenth century room to flourish. It gave us a Golden Age. Pillarization in the twentieth century offered Catholics, Protestants, socialists and liberals a recipe for living with each other's deviant behavior. Through joint willingness, the foundation has been laid for the Netherlands in 2018. That country of unprecedented prosperity and prosperity. We can now also show that unity in diversity is the winning combination.
The municipalities now have more room to set their own priorities. The current government recently entered into a unique partnership with municipalities, provinces and water boards to work across the boundaries of the administrative levels on the issues of today and tomorrow. And there is now an Environmental Act, which provides more room for local considerations when designing the living environment. [...] But is it enough?
I think I have to look for room for experiments within your Municipal and Provincial Act, and your laws offer that space. [...] As if you knew that the solutions of 1848 would not be the solutions of those of 170 years later. The solutions of the future in Rotterdam were not the solutions of the Achterhoek of the future.
Undoubtedly, some things cause unrest and resistance. I hear the counter-thinkers shout: "But how do citizens know how the government functions?" You would undoubtedly be confrontational. Strong on the content. When a Member of Parliament warned you that he would not make himself popular with these measures, you replied: "If there must be popularity, then I do not ask for the popularity of the moment, but for lasting popularity."
Sincerely, I have the honor to be your distant official successor and your servant,
Kajsa Ollongren
