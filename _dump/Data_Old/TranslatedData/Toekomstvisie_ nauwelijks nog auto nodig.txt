UTRECHT - Villagers and city dwellers in the province of Utrecht will hardly need their cars in thirty years. They also eat from the local farmer and live stacked on top of each other.
This can be concluded from the Horizon 2050 report. The province of Utrecht invited residents, entrepreneurs and knowledge institutions to think about the future.
In 2050, the province of Utrecht will be a large sustainable oasis full of greenery, solar panels and cycle paths. At least, if it were up to the hundreds of participants. The province of Utrecht is using the research to draw up the new environmental law, which will come into effect in 2022.
Little space
A rapidly growing population, little space and the drive for sustainability pose a major challenge. For example, the respondents want to preserve greenery, but also provide space for urbanization.
Additional construction, in both cities and villages, must therefore increase in height and depth, as stated in Horizon 2050. Parking spaces have largely disappeared in 2050. After all, the car is no longer necessary. People work via digital roads and get to their location much more easily by public transport, bicycle or self-driving means of transport.
In thirty years' time, residents will suffer fewer health problems due to noise and light pollution. Cities provide their own energy and food comes from their own province as much as possible. Nature reserves are increasingly taking on recreational functions.
