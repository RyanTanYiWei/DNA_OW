The introduction of the far-reaching Environmental Act - with which citizens can quickly obtain permits - has been postponed for the umpteenth time. Minister De Jonge (Public Housing and Spatial Planning) wants another postponement to introduce the law 'in a responsible manner' and will therefore not meet the agreed date of July 1.
The CDA minister announced this on Tuesday. July is not feasible, while the introduction has already been postponed several times. ICT problems are once again throwing a spanner in the works. In the coming weeks, De Jonge will examine whether the implementation date of October 1, 2022 or January 1, 2023 is a feasible option.
'Responsible and careful implementation'
“In recent weeks there have been several consultations with fellow authorities and experts about the introduction of the Environmental Act. This showed that more time is needed to properly practice with the new systems. I want to take that time for a responsible and careful implementation," says De Jonge.
The Environmental Act was supposed to provide a solution to help citizens quickly obtain permits. The government wants to simplify and merge the rules for spatial development. So that it will soon be easier, for example, to start construction projects. But the project has been suffering from financial and IT problems for years.
