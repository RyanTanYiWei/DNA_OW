Amsterdam. The government should not only hope that all Dutch people can participate in decisions about their living environment, but also actually help them in this. This is what the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP) states in an essay about the new 'Environmental Act', which must come into effect from 2018. The law replaces a large number of existing laws and regulations and should make spatial planning simpler and better.
The government expects citizens to be actively involved in the design of their living environment in the 'participation society'. But citizens do not always have the desire or time for this, the planning agency notes. There is also no guarantee that all information about spatial plans is always available, for example due to the "erosion" of local journalism. "The government must ensure the presence of a critical press." Not all citizens are equally well equipped to submit plans or participate in discussions about them; Better situated, higher educated and empowered citizens are better able to protect their living environment than less wealthy residents. This can cause inequality to occur, the SCP warns in the essay entitled Don't count outside the citizen!
