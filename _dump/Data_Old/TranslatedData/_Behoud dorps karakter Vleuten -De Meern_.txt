 Utrecht - The residents of the Vleuten-De Meern district would like to preserve the village-like character of the neighborhood. This is evident from the environmental vision that the municipality of Utrecht has established for the district, which was the first in the region.
An environmental vision contains all the developments that residents of a neighborhood can expect in the short and long term. The vision is part of the environmental law that will be introduced in the Netherlands in the coming years. Vleuten-De Meern is the first sub-area in the Utrecht region with an environmental vision and is an example for the neighborhoods that will follow later. The vision was created in collaboration with residents, companies and organizations from the neighborhood and clearly indicates what they want to preserve and what can be done differently. “Vleuten-De Meern feels like a village within the city. This is an important, unique value for the neighborhood,” the municipality writes. That village character appears to be essential for residents and must therefore be preserved. High buildings are therefore not desirable. Residents also indicated that it is important that there is sufficient greenery and that they can easily meet each other. A pleasant living and working environment and being able to move around the neighborhood comfortably also play an important role. Residents have until June 8 to submit their views against the environmental vision. The vision will be presented to the council after the summer.
