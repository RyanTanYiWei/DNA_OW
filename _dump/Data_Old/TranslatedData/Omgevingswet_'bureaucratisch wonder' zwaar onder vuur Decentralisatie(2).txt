ABSTRACT
Background Digital revolution Local customization, more say for citizens: the Environmental Act must simplify everything. But just before the introduction, municipalities and ICT suppliers doubt whether they can handle further decentralization and digitalization. "The Wild West is looming."
COMPLETE TEXT:
By our editors Rik Rutten and Jos Verlaan
         The largest legislative operation since the constitutional revision of 1848: the Rutte II cabinet announced the Environmental Act in 2014. All regulations on spatial planning, zoning plans, permits from catering to tree felling to the environment - approximately 3,000 articles of law and 120 ministerial regulations - reduced to one simple law, accessible to every citizen, who regains control over their own living environment.
Because on the drawing board, the Environmental Act is a bureaucratic marvel. It won't be long before you can arrange the permit yourself to cut down the tree in your backyard, organize a street party or build a dormer window. The citizen then arranges his own participation procedures. The municipality only sets the rules - and is given more freedom, for example to relax or tighten noise standards or pollution limits. In the ideal scenario, everyone can see the local permits with one click on a digital map.
But five years later, a month before the first major trials start and a year before introduction, the problems are piling up.
Municipalities are short of staff and money. ICT suppliers warn internally of impending fiascos. Even before the law was approved by the Senate, the National Ombudsman set up a special internal task force to process the expected flow of complaints. And parties in the Senate want a postponement - or cancellation. "What is threatening," says Senator Saskia Kluit (GroenLinks), "is a kind of Wild West in spatial planning."
Senator and professor of Public Administration, Peter Nicolaï (Party for the Animals): "It took us thirty years to convert the Civil Code into a New Civil Code. And this bill would have been completed in five years? That is not possible. There is now a monstrosity of legal texts that no one will be able to deal with, including judges and lawyers." On Friday, the Council of Ministers will consider the complications surrounding the introduction of the Environmental Act.
Yet another decentralization
The idea behind the Environmental Act seemed simple: one law to regulate spatial planning, zoning plans and environmental permits instead of the 26 separate laws that currently exist, from soil to odor to noise. The promise: local customization, faster and easier.
With this formula, the Rutte II cabinet also decentralized youth care (Youth Act), long-term care (Wmo) and the labor market (Participation Act) in 2015. As with those decentralizations, the same cabinet estimated that the Environmental Act would save the local civil service millions. For this reason, municipalities themselves bear the majority of the costs. The initial estimates estimated these at approximately 370 million euros.
"But it just doesn't work out," says councilor Klaas Valkering from Bergen. "That's how it was with the previous three decentralizations. The government promises us an efficiency boost that will make everything cheaper, but in the meantime we are given all kinds of additional tasks, which "We don't yet know the costs and effort. Everyone can taste that."
Valkering speaks from experience. Bergen is already working with a number of neighboring municipalities on a program that should guide the introduction of the Environmental Act. This costs the municipalities 3.3 million, but the returns are questionable. Civil servants had to spend an unexpected amount of time adjusting the rules - and their own role. Now they have control over permits, but soon they will facilitate much more.
"Decision-making is now happening very quickly, but the outcomes are unclear," said Valkering.
Earlier this year, the Bergen Mayor and Aldermen warned the Association for Dutch Municipalities (VNG) about the financial consequences of the law. Support first came from the entire Alkmaar region and now also from municipalities from the rest of the country. The VNG speaks of "a major task", although the organization does not yet want to officially ask for a postponement.
Dwindling confidence
Some municipalities are enthusiastic about the introduction of the law: they expect great policy freedom to draw up rules themselves. But optimism is dwindling, according to figures collected partly by the government and the municipalities.
Halfway through 2018, three-quarters of municipalities were still confident that they would be ready on time for the implementation "with the current approach and efforts". Six months later, this was only 57 percent. The number of municipalities that feared they would not be ready on time doubled. , from 16 to 31 percent. Newer figures are not yet known.
In a month's time, the government wants to run large-scale tests before the system can be introduced from 2021. In an expert consultation with the Senate, provinces, but also software suppliers, expressed their doubts about whether this will work. It is now clear that the software is not in order, especially locally, and scenarios are circulating in which implementation is not arranged before 2024. The expected costs have now risen sharply.
The biggest concern among municipalities is the digital system on which the entire Environmental Act is based. Originally, these rules from environmental law decrees were supposed to become accessible to citizens with 'one click on the map'. But in 2017, the government's IT watchdog, the ICT Testing Bureau (BIT), came to a damning verdict. "IT functionalities are so complexly designed that they will lead to problems when creating and using them," the BIT wrote, "and it is questionable whether they will ever all work as intended."
After the BIT advice, the greatest ambitions of the digital implementation system were scaled back. But precisely by scrapping those ambitions, a number of municipalities complain, the returns promised by the government from the entire Environmental Act have also disappeared from view. The costs remain high. Although the programming of the national data systems has been simplified, it is still not ready. That is why the ICT suppliers of the municipalities say that they are currently unable to have the local software ready on time. It has already led to many crisis consultations at the Ministry of the Interior.
'New insights'
Much depends on the decision of the Senate. A number of parties that previously voted in favor of the law in the House of Representatives have now become critical. "Progressive insight", 50Plus leader Henk Krol explains his party's change of course. He voted in favor in the House of Representatives, but now views it differently: "We threw the package over the wall of the Senate too easily. It is right that we vote differently there than in the House of Representatives." In particular, the implementation and dealing with setbacks are not what many members of the Senate find wrong. "I am not against the entire Environmental Act, but how are we really going to do this?" says Jopie Nooren (PvdA). "I think the answer to that has been very poor so far."
Five years after the major decentralizations of Rutte II, municipalities appear to be having great difficulty with their new tasks. The returns are often not as hoped, the costs are often higher than expected. The WMO created neighborhood teams to reduce healthcare costs, but these appear to be more expensive. The Rutte III cabinet is now trying to regain some of the authority with the Youth Act and the Participation Act. Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Health, CDA) wants to transform youth care, State Secretary Tamara van Ark (Social Affairs, VVD) wants to force municipalities to demand compensation from benefit recipients.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Environmental Act is still on track. Minister Stientje van Veldhoven (Environment and Housing, D66) recently called on the Senate to agree to prevent "loss of momentum". At a meeting with administrators last week, she said she has every confidence in the 2021 implementation date. Then, according to the minister, everyone is "ready enough".
