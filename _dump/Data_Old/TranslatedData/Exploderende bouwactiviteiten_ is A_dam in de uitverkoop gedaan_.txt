The existing city within the Ring condenses and petrifies. We recognize ourselves in the article of June 3 about the residents in West. Construction activities are exploding within the Amsterdam Ring. In addition to new construction, old buildings are being basementd and topped up. Five years ago it was mainly owner-occupiers who renovated houses, but now we see more private investors. They want to make money quickly and have little interest in building a good relationship with their neighbors. For the sake of understanding: we would like to see our neighborhood being renovated. But preferably regulated, without subsidence of adjacent buildings, flooding, petrification of the courtyards and construction noise from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
We ask the municipal council for good stewardship of the existing city. Develop an urban Delta Plan with careful permitting, supervision of the quality of the built environment and the construction process and green courtyards. Such a plan is all the more important now that new laws such as the Private Quality Assurance Act and the Environmental Act create a greater freedom of regulation and place more responsibilities on construction clients. We have been waiting for more than two months for an answer to our petition with 125 signatures. Amsterdam councilor Van der Burg remains silent.
Christine van Rooijen and Fike van der Burght, Amsterdam
