Highlight: Housing construction in the Netherlands continues to stall. Existing construction projects are being canceled due to uncertainty about construction costs.

Fear of a decline in the number of houses being built
The number of new building permits is also declining due to staff shortages and new regulations. "Everyone is concerned about how long this will last," says board member Peter Verstegen of Bouwsociëteit Midden Gelderland, which includes contractors, project developers, real estate agents, architects and lawyers from the Arnhem, Betuwe and Nijmegen regions.

The bottleneck is the construction costs: they have risen so quickly that two fully developed construction projects with hundreds of homes in Nijmegen, among others, are not being started. It has become uncertain for developers what construction will cost, so they do not know what to ask for a home. "And sales are declining, due to rising interest rates, candidates for new construction projects are withdrawing."

The Netherlands is struggling with a significant housing shortage. According to government planning, 75,000 houses should be built annually. Those numbers are not being achieved. Construction projects have been delayed in recent years due to, among other things, the nitrogen crisis.

An additional problem is that project developers have great difficulty in arranging zoning plan changes and building permits for new construction plans. According to Michel van Wijk, director of Mecus Planning Development in Huissen, projects are coming to a standstill as a result.

Waiting times at municipalities for permits are increasing due to a lack of staff, while there is also a threat of delays due to the introduction of the new Environmental Act, which will probably have to arrange building permits from January 1. That law has already been passed by the House of Representatives, but the Senate will probably not make a final judgment until October, it became apparent on Tuesday.

That is far too late, warns the Association of Dutch Project Development Companies, which fears that governments and companies will run into 'major problems' because the granting of permits is delayed. And yet the number of building permits is already declining: around 16,000 were issued in the first quarter of this year, compared to 19,000 in the same period last year.
