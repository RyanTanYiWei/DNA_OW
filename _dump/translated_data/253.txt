Body


The municipality of Neder-Betuwe wrote these two questions on 8,700 postcards. Residents will find a characteristic photo of their own village on the front. They can return the postcard with the answers to the town hall without a stamp, where they all end up on the desk of Mayor Jan Kottelenberg.

With the arrival of a new Environmental Act, which, in short, makes regulations a lot simpler because a lot of rules are disappearing, the mayor and alderman want to know what the residents are thinking about.

"The new law requires a new vision from the municipality," says councilor Nees van Wolfswinkel. “Which direction do we want to go? We ask citizens to think along.”

Big advantage: everything becomes simpler. “Cases can be requested in full. Various zoning plans are included in one environmental plan. You only go to one counter. It must be easier. At the same time, it will not be the case that everything is possible.”

In addition to the postcards, there will also be consultation evenings and an explanation will follow in the Neder-Betuwe Magazine. Suggestions for improving the living environment can also be emailed to ambientvisie@nederbetuwe.nl

Van Wolfswinkel: "It would be nice if 15 percent of the residents responded."
