Wageningen's first sports hall, the Olympiahal, is on its last legs after fifty years. The last sports clubs are moving elsewhere. So now the question arises: what will be built on the northern edge of the city center and who will be welcome?

The Wageningen municipal council has unanimously called on the council to draw up a plan this year to involve the residents. The location between Olympiaplein, Buurtseweg, Sportstraat and Spelstraat is centrally located and therefore attractive to many target groups. The municipality owns the sports hall and the land and can determine the rules itself. According to the municipal council, this is an excellent opportunity to test the possibility for participation in the new Environmental Act.

This year, the council wants to determine, on the basis of a council proposal, where the possibilities lie for, for example, housing, retail, but also greenery. And when it comes to housing: who is welcome? These could be students (again), or does it perhaps fit in nicely with the senior housing in the immediate area or is it desirable that families come to live in this neighborhood that is not so child-rich? And how high can the buildings be and how much space should be left for greenery in the rather densely populated and densely built-up neighborhood? The municipal council also wants to decide this year whether the construction plan should generate money for the municipality.
