The PvdA and the SP are concerned about the financing of the Environmental Act. This new law should simplify regulations regarding spatial planning and the living environment. This became apparent yesterday during a debate about the law that should bundle 26 existing laws. The law would yield 650 million euros, but whether enforcement, implementation and monitoring are properly financed, the parties wondered. There is broad support in the House for the plan of Minister Melanie Schultz (Infrastructure and Environment).
