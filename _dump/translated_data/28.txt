The municipality must talk to the residents of Asselt and the developer of the marina in the village to bring both parties closer together.
To this end, the council has instructed aldermen Waajen and Evers with a broadly supported motion, submitted by LVR, GroenLinks and Democrats Swalmen. Councilor Waajen (Spatial Planning) pointed out that the responsibility for citizen participation in accordance with the Environmental Act lies with developer Knols Holding bv. But according to D66, Asselt complains that he "mainly likes monologues and not dialogue".
Anouk Dolmans of GroenLinks wanted to know whether it was true that Waajen said during an election campaign in Asselt that she was in favor of a 'small-scale recreational facility'. A port with six hundred places, as the developer wants, is not that in Dolmans' eyes. That number would be allowed according to the zoning plan, according to a council information letter.
However, the permit granted to the previous owner of the Maasplas in question for a port that never came to be, assumes 360 places. Knols Holding has applied for a new one based on that old permit. That application is currently being processed by the municipality, councilor Rens Evers (permits) said.
According to various parties, the unrest in Asselt is mainly due to the lack of clarity about the scale.
