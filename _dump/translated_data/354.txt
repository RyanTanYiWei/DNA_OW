Not in my backyard (nimby) is a well-known phenomenon, especially in the current me era. Just about every construction plan encounters objections from local residents. Views that are affected, privacy, a piece of public greenery that disappears, parking spaces in front of the door. The new Environmental Act, which has already been postponed several times, stipulates that a developer must sit down with local residents to coordinate his plans with the neighborhood, but it is an impossible task to please everyone.
If 'obstacles' litigate all the way to the Council of State, it will take a number of years before the shovel can be put into the ground. To minimize the Nimby effect, De Jonge wants to shorten the procedure. Objectors will soon only be able to go to court once instead of twice. Only the Council of State will then consider objections and a decision must be made within six months. It sounds like music to the ears of municipalities and developers, but the question is whether it is (legally) feasible.
