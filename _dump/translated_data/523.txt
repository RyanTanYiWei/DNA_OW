Highlight: The municipality of Sint Anthonis has added six new supervisors in one fell swoop. They will help check compliance with the rules in the catering industry and at events.
Body


The new employees are from the MB-ALL agency in Utrecht. Sint Anthonis will appoint the six as unpaid civil servants and as supervisors. So Sint Anthonis does not employ them himself.

The regulators are needed to monitor the rules in the field of structures, infrastructure, water systems, water, soil, air, landscapes, nature, cultural heritage and world heritage. All these components are part of the physical, tangible living environment. Activities that influence the living environment also fall under these regulations.

The agency that Sint Anthonis works with for the supervisors already works for 130 other Dutch municipalities. They provide employees for supervision, legal services and enforcement of safety and quality of life to municipalities.

The new national Environmental Act would actually be introduced in 2019. But that introduction has been postponed until January 1, 2021.
