BERKELLAND
In a few years, residents of the municipality of Berkelland will be able to obtain the permit to build within eight weeks. The municipality will spend 1.7 million euros for the introduction of the new Environmental Act that makes this possible in 2019.

As of 2019, the Environmental Act combines 26 laws and hundreds of regulations in the field of the living environment. Anyone who wants to carry out something that requires a change in the spatial destination will soon have to take more into account what local residents want. "We will be talking to neighborhoods much more often," says councilor Patricia Hoytink.

It is also the intention that the application and processing of the required permit for a project will proceed much faster, more than three times as fast as in the current situation.
