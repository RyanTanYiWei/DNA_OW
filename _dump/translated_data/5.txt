The average processing time for applications under the Environmental Act is 48 days. This law covers, for example, the construction of dormer windows. Residents do not need a building permit for this, but it is subject to notification. From December, the municipality hopes to significantly shorten the average processing time for these types of cases.
Heerlen wants to optimize services for citizens and entrepreneurs with a seventeen-point improvement plan. For example, civil servants have received further training on the Environmental Act. According to the council, a cultural change will also be necessary. Nowadays, the approach to permit applications is often 'no, unless'. According to the city council, a more positive approach ('yes, provided') is more effective and also leads to more satisfied customers.
Because there is a maze of rules for applying for building permits, for example, there will be a consultation hour where applicants will receive clear information. To improve communication, the municipality will now use level B1 in texts, comparable to the language level of students in the third year of secondary education.
Heerlen also wants to improve services for entrepreneurs. For example, there will be a sounding board group for them and the Ondernemershuis will also be intensively involved in this improvement plan. High on the wish list is also a track-and-trace system. An app will be launched nationally with which citizens and entrepreneurs can monitor the progress of their (permit) application. Heerlen wants to join in on this.
