The housing costs for an average household in Beekdaelen will amount to 892 euros in 2021. That is 14 percent higher than the national average, but represents only a slight increase for most residents. The biggest blow falls in the former municipality of Onderbanken. It had an even lower rate for sewerage charges. That now goes from 241 to 284 euros per year in one fell swoop. For the residents of the former municipalities of Schinnen and Nuth, the harmonization is a windfall: there the rate drops by 15 (Nuth) and 8 euros (Schinnen) to 284 euros per year.
All residents will pay a little more expensively because the property tax (real estate tax) and the waste levy will increase. The property tax increases by 5 euros to an average of 338 euros per year. Residents will pay 269 euros in waste tax next year, 15 euros more.
A budget deficit of 2.500,000 (2022) and 1,000,000 (2023) is at risk for the following years. This is mainly because youth care is more expensive, while the contribution from the municipal fund is lagging behind.
The municipality needs extra manpower to process the large number of complaints about maintenance of green areas, waste, traffic and enforcement via the digital reporting point Fixi. Two enforcers and two special investigating officers (boas) have their hands full with supervision, but can hardly or hardly cope with the work.
Beekdaelen expects to receive fewer fees due to the introduction of the Environmental Act in 2022. The new rules mean that permits must be applied for digitally and the municipality has less work to do on supervision.
