 SAFETY
SITTARD-GELEEN
To maintain an acceptable level of safety within the municipality, Sittard-Geleen must work on a clearer policy. More attention should be paid to pipes for the transport of hazardous substances.
It is also recommended that citizens be better involved in policy.
This is evident from the evaluation of the external safety policy by Antea Group on behalf of B and W.
The evaluation is partly intended to reveal areas for improvement in view of the new Environmental Act, which the government wants to introduce in 2021.
Mayor Sjraar Cox informs the municipal council that the safety policy of recent years appears to be satisfactory according to the evaluation. This policy is mainly aimed at determining whether (new) construction plans near risk sources, such as Chemelot, are responsible or what safety requirements they must meet. According to Cox, the evaluation showed that the basic level of protection in the municipality was 'maintained' between 2011 and 2017.
Antea Group notes that the municipality has two important visions: one focused on Chemelot and the other on the transport of hazardous substances by rail. Because the areas to which these visions relate partly overlap, discussion may arise about which safety rules are now mandatory. Antea Group therefore insists on an integrated vision, which must also be coordinated with Beek and Stein, which also border Chemelot. According to Cox, this should lead to an integral 'assessment framework' for (building) permits.
