COMPLETE TEXT:
by Job van der Meer
 BEMMEL - Councilor Bert Frings leaves a deficit of 1.55 million on the Wmo (Social Support Act) item upon his departure from Lingewaard. The deficit of more than one and a half million euros is an estimate for 2012 and may turn out to be better or worse in the course of this year.
 Because the economy is going badly, the municipality needs more money for special assistance this year. Lingewaard expects that to be 270,000 euros.
 An amount of €500,000 is due to a higher demand for Wmo facilities than budgeted, such as home adjustments. That five thousand euros is increased by another scheme that can be used regardless of the money available: student transport.
 165,000 more will be spent on this in the coming year than previously estimated.
 An additional 399,000 euros will be added this year for the 33 refugees who must be accommodated in Lingewaard before July 1.
 Finally, the municipality of Lingewaard receives two thousand euros less in construction fees. This is because less construction is taking place and because the new Wabo environmental law requires fewer permits.
