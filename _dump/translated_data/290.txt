ABSTRACT
Interview John Henssen, former spatial planning inspector
The government has transferred supervision of spatial planning to lower authorities. According to former spatial planning inspector John Henssen, that doesn't work. "It's not going to get better by itself."
COMPLETE TEXT:
When he travels through the Netherlands, former spatial planning inspector John Henssen becomes concerned. In just a few years, he saw the landscape change dramatically: enormous distribution centers emerged, agriculture became even more intensive, energy-guzzling data centers emerged, new residential areas were built close to highways.
The former inspector, who has been retired for a year, is even more concerned about the things he does not see. Henssen (67) supervised spatial planning for fifteen years. First for the Ministry of Spatial Planning and the Environment, when it was abolished for the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT). Together with about fifty colleagues, he reviewed up to a hundred new zoning plans every week. Every plan to build something in the Netherlands - a road, house or factory - went through his team. Over the past ten years, the department has been increasingly stripped down: tasks disappeared and employees left. When Henssen retired, the supervision of spatial planning ceased to exist.
Henssen, originally a traffic and urban planner, checked whether so-called "national spatial interests" were being compromised by the plans of municipalities. These are national goals for spatial development that have been established by the government, and to which municipalities and provinces adhere. For example, they may not allow housing development next to a military airport or in a flood area, and must take into account the effects of their plans on safety and health.
For example, did a municipality - contrary to those national goals - want to build homes close to a place where explosives are stored? Then Henssen intervened. He ensured that municipalities changed the plans. If they refused, inspectors like Henssen could destroy the plans. Those powers were abolished in 2012. The spatial planning inspection was abolished.
The government, under the spell of decentralization, thought that lower levels of government could handle it themselves. Municipalities and provinces were happy that this troublesome inspection left them alone from now on. Henssen was left with a small group and investigated whether municipalities and provinces continued to adhere to the national spatial development goals of their own accord - without a national supervisor. Until his retirement last year. Now there is no one at national level who checks whether municipal zoning plans are safe. No one checks whether the health of citizens is sufficiently protected.
What do you see happening?
"Look at Delft, a new housing estate is being built there right next to the highway. The homes do not meet noise standards, so the purchase contract states that residents are not allowed to sleep in the attic. But something like that is not allowed at all: you cannot put the right aside with a clause in a contract. That is a middle finger to the Noise Pollution Act. I would have laid down for that. But nowadays no one watches it anymore. Formally speaking, the province has to do that, but apparently there is not enough manpower or interest to check all that."
What does the average citizen notice?
"If you as a citizen do not pay attention, your interests are not properly protected. As an inspector, we checked all zoning plans. There was nothing wrong with most plans, but we intervened if they conflicted with national rules. A citizen now has to do that himself. That presupposes a certain assertiveness and a certain level of knowledge. But as a citizen you often don't know what the risks are."
Supervision will not have been completely abolished, will it?
“No, it has been left to the provinces. But that doesn't work: how can a provincial official protect national interests? That's not his job. The problem is that responsibility for national goals falls to the alderman and deputy. But that councilor has to stand up for the interests of his municipality, and then he sometimes puts national interests aside. A Frisian civil servant once said: 'What have I to do with your goals?' In fact he is right about that. It doesn't work without government supervision."
The government published a national environmental vision in 2020, containing 21 national goals for spatial development, such as protection of the environment, protection against toxic substances and floods and the construction of sufficient housing. The government concludes agreements with local governments to achieve these goals. But according to Henssen, there is no one who checks whether municipal plans are in line with those national goals.
"When the tasks were transferred to the provinces, they said that they would need 75 full-time people for this. They never came. The tasks were transferred, but there were hardly any people or resources to carry out those tasks. We have a policy of: letting everything go and hoping it will work out. But things won't work out on their own."
Henssen should know. In 2018, six years after the inspection was abolished, Henssen conducted research on behalf of the ILT into the protection of national interests in spatial planning. Together with four colleagues, he examined hundreds of zoning plans. The conclusion: the system does not work properly. Municipalities appeared to insufficiently respect the safety zones around the storage of explosives. Housing construction was made possible within the noise zones of military airfields, while this is not legally allowed. And municipalities paid too little attention to the cluttering of the landscape.
“It was worrying. For example, we discovered a small warehouse in a residential area in Purmerend where explosives were stored. Enough to wipe out that entire neighborhood. Then you can say: 'I no longer have a task'. But in such a case I go to my boss, who calls the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment. The place was cleaned up within three days."
Yet the alarming report had to remain under wraps: the ILT and the Ministry of the Interior refused to make the report public. Ultimately, it came to light via NRC in 2020.
"It was an unwanted message," Henssen says now. "The ministry was working on the Environmental Act, the whole idea of ​​that law is to deregulate and decentralize even further. Then a critical report would be inconvenient. They just didn't want to know. The report was originally called 'spatial interests in trouble'. But my bosses at the ILT did not allow that, it was far too provocative."
Three days after the critical report was established, Henssen's entire department was closed down. The officials had noted numerous shortcomings. But the team that could solve the problems was reassigned to other work.
And now?
“Now no one watches it anymore. The national rules for noise pollution, hazardous substances and flood risk, for example, still exist, but there is no one left to check whether municipalities are adhering to them."
What does that mean for problems such as environmental pollution and drought, or for the plans to build a million homes?
“There is no longer a plan for the organization of the country. Each municipality makes its own plans, but there is no one left who says: 'We are going that way'. This is now becoming increasingly visible, ten years after the decentralizations. Just when plans are needed to build new homes on a large scale and reorganize agriculture, just when the problems with drought, flooding and salinization are becoming increasingly acute, there is a lack of direction. Building 1 million homes is not possible without government direction. Restoring nature is not possible without government goals.
"In addition, the Minister for Spatial Planning (Hugo de Jonge, ed.) no longer has any idea what is happening in the country. As an inspectorate, we were the eyes and ears of the minister. We visited municipalities every year to discuss spatial planning and the environment and reported on this to The Hague. We would have anticipated developments such as the rapid increase in distribution centers or data centers. The ministry could then have made policy on this. But the ministry no longer has those eyes and ears."
The Interprovincial Consultation says in a response that it "does not have the impression" that the supervision of spatial planning is not going well. Minister for Housing and Spatial Planning Hugo de Jonge does acknowledge that "improvements are possible" in that area. De Jonge says that the government is "repackaging" national management. The minister is currently making agreements with provinces about spatial plans. In the field of housing construction, these agreements must be enforceable.
Does that remove the objections?
,,No. An appointment is something completely different from supervision. These types of agreements concern specific projects or topics: one dike, one new residential area. It's not about the whole thing. We oversaw all national interests, all over the country. You cannot replace that with separate agreements. With such a system you create inequality in the protection of citizens.
"What has always bothered me is that everything has to be faster and simpler. Spatial planning is becoming increasingly complex: the Netherlands is becoming more crowded, problems with nature and climate change are becoming more serious. Then weighing up interests becomes increasingly difficult and painful, and it doesn't help if you just say that things should be faster and easier. This means that some interests are no longer taken into account. You should not want to."
