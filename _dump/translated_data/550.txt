In the Borculose town hall, Gerjan Teselink has surprisingly been conjured up as a proposed VVD councilor. The 35-year-old Eibergen resident has served as leader of the VVD faction in recent years. Teselink will have the portfolios of Economy, Finance, Sustainability and the Participation Act. Teselink is joined in the council by three female aldermen. Marijke van Haaren from Lochem and Patricia Hoytink from Ruurlo were both already members of the council on behalf of the CDA. Van Haaren will deal with the Social Support Act, Youth Care, Rural Zoning Plan and Nature and Landscape. Hoytink focuses on Spatial Planning, Housing, the Environmental Act, Vital Countryside and Connecting Government. Anjo Bosman from Borculo takes office for the first time as alderman for Municipal Interests Berkelland. She will be given the portfolios of Public Space and Climate, Sports, Education, Childcare, Music, Art and Culture, Monumental Heritage, Recreation and Tourism.
