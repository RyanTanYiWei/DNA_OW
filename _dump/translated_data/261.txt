The annual accounts of the municipality of Meerssen show a plus: 2.8 million on a budget of 58 million euros in total.
The windfalls are mainly in the costs of sheltering Ukrainian refugees, which turned out to be cheaper compared to the government's contribution, and the energy compensation from the government, which was higher. Associations and community centers have claimed less compensation than expected. Less was also spent on youth protection and domestic help. The latter is mainly because there is less help due to staff shortages among providers.
Sewer costs have risen considerably. But so does the income: Meerssen has the highest sewerage tax in Limburg. The balance is also positive because expenditure has simply not (yet) been incurred: introduction of the Environmental Act has been postponed, the playground policy has fallen behind, no party has yet been found to take on jobs that the IKL previously did and the planned strengthening of the neighborhood teams has not yet been implemented.
