 MOTION CDA
VAALS
Mayor Reg van Loo and clerk Bart Hoevenagel of Vaals will fine-tune the new council after the elections in March next year.
CDA faction leader John Coenen submitted a motion to this effect during the council meeting on Monday. In it, he asked Van Loo and Hoevenagel, in close consultation with the current municipal council, to design an 'official and politically neutral training program' that addresses, among other things, tasks and powers, dualism, joint arrangements, partnerships and municipal finances. Coenen: "As the current municipal council, we also have a responsibility towards the future municipal council, whose composition will probably differ from the current composition. National parties may offer political training, but they are not effective. These are often media training sessions that only focus on ideas and not on how a budget cycle works, for example. And certainly not tailored to Vaals. While at the start of a new council term, major matters are discussed with major financial consequences, such as implementing the environmental law or setting up a new strategic vision."
