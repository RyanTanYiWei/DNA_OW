Deterioration threatens for monument (22/10)
Of course, as a councilor for Monuments you have to scream bloody murder if private subsidy options for national monuments disappear. I don't know if he is aware of it, but most monument owners live in the city center, because it was nice to live there.
Yes: laundry! The attack that the municipal council and center management are making on the habitability and quality of life is therefore much more worrying than the loss of subsidies. With the unconditional increase in visitor numbers, the failure to put a brake on house division, the uncritical embrace of 'innovative' concepts and the useless fiddling with customized schemes in response to yet another incident, it appears that there is still a lack of a cultural-historical quality direction.
Even more shocking is the proper motivation of all those ad hoc decisions, but that is where the municipal council will soon find itself in the crossfire. When the new Environmental Act (2019) comes into effect, the government will be explicitly held accountable for its argumentation, motivation and substantiation of policy decisions and plans. If people want to be at the forefront of the march against the abolition of monument subsidies, first make sure you are heard, because you have a quality-oriented policy for your monumental city center.
Adjusting zoning plan rules in a subsidized way for breeding grounds when monuments are vacant is only a sign of administrative poverty.
