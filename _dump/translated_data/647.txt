The municipality of Peel en Maas ends 2022 with a positive balance of almost eight million. Part of that money will be reserved for the energy surcharge and the introduction of the Environmental Act. The majority disappears into savings.
The fact that Peel en Maas has money left over is mainly due to additional subsidies from the government. In addition, the municipality was able to save a lot because the reception of Ukrainian refugees was cheaper. Bottom line, Peel en Maas will have 7,969,000 euros left over this year. A fair amount, according to Mayor Wilma Delissen-van Tongerlo. In recent years, Peel en Maas has not been able to save such a high amount.
Part of the almost eight million goes to maintenance, heritage policy and the future-proof living project in the countryside. Unused budgets are also transferred to next year. A larger amount, approximately 800,000 euros, has been reserved for the energy surcharge.
550,000 euros will also be released for the introduction of the Environmental Act. The vast majority disappears into the piggy bank.
However, some caution is being exercised due to the sharp increase in inflation.
