Highlight: Can the Snollebollekes and The Streamers still perform in the GelreDome in the future? If it is up to the Arnhem city council, yes, provided something is done about the vibrations that local residents experience.

During The Streamers' concert last fall, residents of a nearby apartment complex suffered so much from vibrations that the building was evacuated for a short time. It was remarkable that residents of a flat further away experienced hardly any inconvenience.

The vibrations experienced by local residents are related to 'the public dancing and jumping exuberantly', the city council informed the city council.

Unlike noise standards - it is nationally determined that the sound at a concert may never be louder than 103 decibels - the current permit for the GelreDome does not include any regulations for vibrations.

According to the city council, this is necessary to maintain GelreDome as a major event location, without local residents suffering as a result. In addition, the new Environmental Act, which came into effect on January 1 of this year, obliges municipalities to provide clarity about this.

Arnhem will do that too. The municipality is in discussions about this with Exploitatiemaatschappij GelreDome, the organization responsible for programming in the stadium in Arnhem-Zuid.

'The approach is to find a solution together that makes it possible to continue existing events. At the same time, we are of course aware of the nuisance that vibrations can cause to our residents and we believe it is important that this nuisance is at an acceptable level.'
