CHAMBER DEBATE
THE HAGUE PvdA and SP are concerned about the financing of the Environmental Act. This new law should ensure enormous simplification of regulations surrounding building, spatial planning and the living environment. This became apparent yesterday during a debate about the law that should bundle 26 existing laws. I have concerns about the financial side, said Albert de Vries (PvdA). The law would yield 650 million euros, but is enforcement, implementation and supervision well funded, he wondered. What are the costs of the law and where do they fall? SP member Eric Smaling wanted to know.
There is broad support in the House for the plan of Minister Melanie Schultz (Infrastructure and Environment).
It should ensure that companies and citizens will soon have to apply for fewer building permits.
This should also be faster and easier. The law should enter into force in 2018.
