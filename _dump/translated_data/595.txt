THE HAGUE
State Secretary Paul Blokhuis (CU, Public Health) does not want to take away anyone's croquette.
But the man behind the National Prevention Agreement also sees that the rapid rise of fast food does not exactly help combat obesity. "Four fast food chains together along the highway are difficult to reconcile with the aim of making the Netherlands eat healthier."
While the government is trying to make cigarettes disappear from the streets in all kinds of ways, the situation is different with unhealthy food. "Because the cigarette is so clearly a deadly article. Twenty thousand Dutch people die from it every year, we just don't want that. That is why we make the product less visible on all sides and more expensive.
That does not mean that the government will immediately make fries more expensive."
 environmental code
In response to the AD survey, Blokhuis said he would like to see whether he can help aldermen who want fewer fast-food restaurants in their municipality. "I think this is a good agenda item for the coming years. The new Environmental Act will come into effect in 2021. Public health becomes an aspect that must be taken into account in spatial planning. Perhaps this offers an opportunity for the subject of fast food. I wouldn't rule that out."
