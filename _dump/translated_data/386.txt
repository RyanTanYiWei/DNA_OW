There are plans for a solar park in the rural area of ​​Lievelde. Two entrepreneurs want to generate energy with solar panels on their own land on the Nieuwendijk.

The municipality of Oost Gelre is positive about the initiative, but does set requirements in advance. These concern the way in which local residents and other stakeholders are involved in the preparations. The entrepreneurs themselves must propagate the initiative and in this way ensure that the plan receives sufficient support.

For the municipality of Oost Gelre, this is a pilot with the new Environmental Act. Communication with outside parties by initiators plays a central role in this.

The decision whether there will ultimately be a solar park remains in the hands of the municipal council.
