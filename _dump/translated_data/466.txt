We are one of the most digitalized countries in the world. We're cool with that. Perhaps we are also among the most debilitated. ICT makes us crazy. Computer systems do not know whether to eat themselves first or others first. The Tax Authorities do not receive any allowances. The police are unable to tap criminals.
Take the new Environmental Act. This should bring the entire spatial planning and housing development of our country under one big umbrella. The government wants to merge and 'simplify' 26 laws and more than 100 rules. Usually that's when the trouble really starts: when they want to simplify in The Hague. The new monster law should have already come into effect in 2015. But that would have been a digital catastrophe. Now we can close our hands when it comes to the middle of next year. The law falls under Minister Hugo de Jonge of housing construction. What falls under De Jonge falls hard. We know from the corona period that he always walked so far ahead of the troops in his nice shoes that only Sywert van Lienden with his face masks could follow him a little. Was it wise to make a man in snakeskin shoes head of the construction site?
Back to the IT misery. Giraffes developed a long neck to eat higher from the tree. In the not too distant future we will also see the evolution in our maternity rooms. Babies will make vigorous scrolling movements with their fingers from birth. If nothing happens, they will start screaming for their mother. Or an IT professional.
