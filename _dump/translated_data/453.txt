Unrest among shopkeepers about Loods 5 (24/11)
With 15,000 square meters of new retail space, you are immediately assured of around 300,000 customers. You simply pull them away from the environment.
The province's involvement in the amount of retail space apparently does not apply to Maastricht. The successful shopping planning in this city is evident from Mosae Forum.
And Loods 5 is only slightly larger.
Fortunately, the legislator, having learned from the many implausible advance calculations and exaggerated growth expectations, will soon make it mandatory in the new Environmental Act to better substantiate decisions.
But you can already see that the Council of State is assessing sustainability and concept breaking. Objections are therefore certainly not hopeless.
Frans van Ekert, Maastricht
