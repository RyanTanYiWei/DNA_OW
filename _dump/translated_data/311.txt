<B> RESIDENTS OPINION </B>
MAASTRICHT
More attention to living in the city center. Fewer cars and more space for pedestrians and bicycles in the center. More spread of events.
These are some of the themes that residents of Maastricht suggested during the broad-based information evenings about a new welfare memorandum, an adaptation of the one from 2004 (see story above). These are topics that affect prosperity, but are often broader and have therefore been identified as useful in drawing up an environmental vision that Maastricht wants to draw up in the run-up to the introduction of the new Environmental Act in 2019.
<B>Unknown</B>
In March, the city council held three meetings to update the aesthetics memorandum and 3,366 participants of the Maastricht Panel were asked about aesthetics rules and suggestions for improvement. 1,051 respondents responded, half of whom indicated that they were unfamiliar with the rules. Thirty percent argue for more customization, less than one in five wants fewer rules.
The most striking conclusion: the majority of those surveyed are satisfied with the quality of the city and its layout. It is also the basis for the broad understanding of the aesthetic rules that give Maastricht a unique quality. There are also suggestions for improving quality. In residential areas, more attention should be paid to mixing functions.
<B>More car-free</B>
Living in the city center is on the rise and more attention should be paid to this. More and more people see the car as a dissonance in public space.
The city council is challenged to make the center less car-free, in favor of pedestrians and cyclists, who keep Maastricht liveable.
Cyclists should also be served better, specifically in terms of stables. The expansion of the center towards Tapijnkazerne, the Belvédère area and the Groene Loper will create more opportunities for event distribution.
Extra attention to more greenery in neighborhoods and the city center also scores high on the wish list of the people who completed the survey about prosperity.
