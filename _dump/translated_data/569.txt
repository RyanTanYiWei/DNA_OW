The MET ggz foundation wants to open a branch on Hoofdstraat in Hoensbroek. The Elderly Party Heerlen (OPH) has reservations about the plan. The council sees no reason to reject it.
OPH points to a council decision not to burden neighborhoods that accommodate vulnerable residents with new, similar facilities. According to the party, the arrival of a treatment center for mental health care (GGZ) may lead to an undesirable development, because Hoensbroek already houses several healthcare organizations and residents with psychological problems.
Councilor Marco Peters (Environmental Act, CDA) sees no reason to reject the application for an environmental permit in this case. He emphasizes that there is no housing. And it concerns a move within Hoensbroek (MET ggz is now located on the Heisterberg), which means that no new facility will be added. A center for outpatient guidance for approximately 270 to 300 clients will be built on Hoofdstraat. Hoensbroek is one of the focus areas of the National Program Heerlen-Noord. One of the recommendations is not to place an additional burden on vulnerable neighborhoods by housing people with a mental health background or migrant workers, which often causes nuisance. Last year, residents of Hoensbroek complained about nuisance from a building for assisted living on the corner of Mgr. Lebouillestraat/Kouvenderstraat.
