Minister Hugo de Jonge (Spatial Planning) is postponing the introduction of the Environmental Act until July next year. He has long insisted on introducing the law on January 1, 2023, but still thinks it is irresponsible to stick to that date, he informed the House of Representatives.
The direct reason for his decision is the highly critical report of the ICT Assessment Advisory Board, which was drawn up at the request of the Senate. The so-called Digital System Environment Act (DSO) - crucial for the implementation of the law - still has 'significant limitations' that will lead to risks if the law is introduced on January 1, the Advisory Board said in its advice published on Monday. Although it does not specify a date of entry into force, it can be read between the lines that the council considers introduction as of January 1 to be irresponsible.
According to De Jonge, it cannot be avoided that there will be a temporary 'small dip' in the number of permits that companies and citizens can apply for when the new law comes into effect. But he wants to prevent this from coming to a complete standstill. The minister wants to give the municipalities and provinces that have to work with the DSO more time to practice with the new law and make other preparations.
