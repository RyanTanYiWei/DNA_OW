Wiel Felder expects that insight into the construction history of monumental buildings will facilitate the assessment of applications for renovation.
The new Environmental Act states that municipalities can request a building history study when assessing building applications for special buildings.
"It is useful if you can judge for yourself whether a simple quick scan is sufficient, or whether a more in-depth investigation by experts is needed," Felder explains.
It is also good to draw the attention of applicants for such a permit at an early stage to special features in their building, he believes: "Then their architect can take this into account."
