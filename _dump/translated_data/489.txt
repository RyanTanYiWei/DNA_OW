Commentary
It seems somewhat exaggerated to describe our king as a visionary. But credit where credit is due, Willem-Alexander, as crown prince, did put the concept of water management on the international agenda. It seems as if with his transformation into king the attention for water slowly fades away. That is undesirable.

This week in De Gelderlander, CEO of water company Vitens, Jelle Hannema, points out the dangers his company faces. Substances end up in the groundwater that pose a risk to drinking water. It is becoming increasingly busier underground. Responsibility for groundwater is not properly allocated. And, not unimportantly, consumers take clean drinking water for granted. So obvious that it is difficult to draw attention to it.

As of January 1, 2021, municipal councilors will have more say in the field of spatial planning. The new Environmental Act places clearer responsibility on the municipalities. This is reason for Vitens director Hannema to warn the voter: in March, choose someone who knows his stuff, because drinking water interests must soon be explicitly taken into account in spatial decisions.

The appeal is sympathetic, but probably not very effective. It is more obvious to draw parties' attention to the importance of water and persuade them to include this subject in the party manifesto. The politicians who pay attention to the subject can distinguish themselves from the parties that bury their heads in the sand about it. This undoubtedly generates more attention for the importance of good groundwater management than Vitens' appeal to the individual voter.

Vitens' timing is good. There is currently little attention for the new Environmental Act. Yet the choice of voters in March determines who will implement the law and therefore how.
