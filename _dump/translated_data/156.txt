At the request of the municipality of Vaals, Wijndomein Sint Martinus first discussed these plans with local residents in a sounding board group.
This is an experiment in the prelude to the introduction of the Environmental Act, a mandatory part of the process for drawing up spatial plans.
It is the first time that Vaals has been able to experience how this method of participation works. According to Vaals councilor John Coenen, the municipality is "happy and grateful with the experiences we can gain during this environmental dialogue."
Coenen does expect that the government will give more shape to the dialogue, because there may still be uncertainty about the expectations and outcome of such a dialogue.
