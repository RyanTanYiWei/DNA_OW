The municipality of Maasgouw wants to keep up the momentum with a plan for a care complex in Wessem. She has found a way to save several months of time.
Maasgouw sees an opportunity to save time in the procedure surrounding the so-called declaration of no reservations. The municipal council must issue this statement if an initiative requires a change to the environmental permit. By waiving such a declaration now, the lead time for the permit procedure will be shortened by five months.
The council argues that the plan meets a need. Maasgouw is one of the most aging municipalities in the region and the care apartments are therefore desirable. Moreover, this is not a regular home, but a complex with sixteen 'care units' and a service home for providing 24-hour care.
The municipality also indicates that the rules regarding permits will change as of January 1 due to the introduction of the new Environmental Act. The initiator would prefer to submit his plans under the current regulations because there are still uncertainties in the new legislation.
Several vacant barns in the area will be demolished for the care complex. Parking spaces will be created at De Kemp, where the entrance to the complex will also be located.
The municipal council will decide on the proposal of the municipal executive at the November council meeting.
