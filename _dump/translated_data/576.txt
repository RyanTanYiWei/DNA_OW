You can fill columns with reasons to distrust the Dutch government. From Environmental Law to benefits affair, from integrity issues to swearing MPs: anyone looking for reasons to emigrate has a list full. But before you book that plane ticket: make a note of the reasons not to distrust the Dutch government. That list is longer, and it grew yesterday.
That was when the conclusions of a major investigation into Indonesia's War of Independence were published. This history has been kept silent for so long that everything you say about it now is idiotically sensitive; My previous sentence alone stands on at least three toes at once. We must therefore be at a loss now that the researchers conclude that there was 'structural and extreme violence' on the Dutch side. Not that we didn't know that, not that we didn't know that even then, but such a heavy judgment crushes any twigs you could still hide behind. “Deep apologies,” Prime Minister Rutte offered Indonesia. Not only for the violence, executions and torture, but also for looking away. Judges looked away, so did the army leadership, especially The Hague. Not exactly plus points on the balance sheet, but mentioning this and admitting it - even if it is very late - restores at least some of the damaged trust.
The India study had to compete on the news pages with the results of another report: how adequately has the Dutch government responded to corona? Well, not that adequate, according to the Dutch Safety Board. Empty promises, bluff, improvisation. The fact that former corona minister Hugo de Jonge immediately started shooting back indicates that this is not a desk drawer report. Now it's not about who is to blame for what. On the contrary: it creates confidence that we live in a country in which you can critically examine the past - recent or long ago. In which it is even arranged that institutions do this, and that government departments measure each other.
Try this in China, Russia, Turkey or one of the growing number of other places where the past is something that is proclaimed by decree. Where deviation from the prescribed view of the past is punishable. Where disinformation has been elevated to canon. Wait – disinformation? And what about the US with its 'weapons of mass destruction' in Iraq? True, but such a misstep can be openly denounced in the US (or here) by journalists, historians and citizens. That's the difference with democracy: an autocracy never fails, by definition. The strongest signal that your government can be trusted is that all kinds of things are openly going wrong.
