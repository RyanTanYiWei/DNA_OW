If the municipal council has no reservations, migrant workers in Leudal will be allowed to live again in temporary housing units such as mobile homes at the companies where they work. Maximum three months per year.
Leudal wants to reverse the 2021 policy for housing migrant workers to the situation of 2015. This means that migrants will be allowed to live in temporary units again. This situation, which is covered by the new Environmental Act, applies to a maximum of thirty people and for a total of five years.
Leudal had abolished living in mobile homes with the focus on permanent and better housing. The municipality thought its appearance better suited the rural environment and the pursuit of higher quality of living and accommodation.
However, companies reported only needing housing for a few months per year, during peak times. "The costs for permanent homes are then not realistic," says councilor Robert Martens.
