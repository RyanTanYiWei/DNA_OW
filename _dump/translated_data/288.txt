I went to vote for the city council yesterday. I could have gone today or tomorrow. The festival of democracy now lasts three days. Just as long as carnival. Both also often end with a hangover. For example, in the 2019 State election, Herrie Baudet's Forum for Democracy became the largest party in the country. From nowhere. Fortunately, Baudet now skillfully leads the party back to nothing. With greetings from Putin.
I don't envy all those women and men who stand for election. They have a lot coming their way. The Hague comes up with increasingly complex laws and the municipalities are allowed to implement them. Take the new Environmental Act. This should make everything in the field of spatial planning simpler. Simpler? The law is so complicated that attempts have been going on to have it introduced for five years. Attempts to do it with fewer rules are accompanied by enormous regulations.
The most important quality in politics is sharp vision. You must have good eyesight. Tackling problems starts with looking. Politics would rather do nothing. You read it every day: we need to take a closer look at that. This watching can go on endlessly. Refined politicians have watched so much that they have eyes. At the other extreme are the directors of run je rot. Always busy with everything and nothing. In no time they will become stress chickens. This type of person has existed for a long time. About 350 years ago the German writer Lichterhand observed: 'People who never have time do the least.'
