Student housing (various articles)
Why is it so difficult to make good arrangements for room rental and division of homes?
That question is answered when you have a city council that knows better than the residents of the city center. They indicated how they wanted to see this included in the new City Center zoning plan. Rule 1: a home may not be permanently subdivided in such a way that it cannot immediately be used again as a family home. When splitting up for room rental, at least one room remains for shared use, and there is room for a bicycle shed and a household waste shed. You provide a student housing foundation that is responsible for the management and therefore has enforcement powers in the event of nuisance. Something that has been the most normal thing in every student city for years. Rule 2: granting a permit may not harm the quality of life. The relationship with parking spaces is effective. Rule 3: breach of concept regarding the original character of the environment.
A quality criterion where, with the new Environmental Act and recent case law from the Council of State, the municipality will soon have gold in its hands, if it does its homework in advance.
