<B>BACKGROUND COLLABORATION</B>
EIJSDEN/GULPEN/VAALS
They have the same DNA. It is therefore obvious that Eijsden-Margraten, Vaals and Gulpen-Wittem work together. That club shouldn't get much bigger, they think.
One large Heuvelland community would soon have almost fifty church villages. "This will create a huge gap between government and the population," expects Jos Custers, alderman in Eijsden-Margraten for years. "Now I walk in a procession almost every Sunday," he says, "which invariably ends on the terrace from the local cafe. In the afternoon I go home with a stack of beer coasters, with notes of what I have seen myself or what residents have told me. If the municipality becomes too large, you lose that direct contact with the citizens."
<B>Environmental Act</B>
Eijsden-Margraten, Gulpen-Wittem and Vaals - connected by bus line 50/350 - have been working together in more and more areas in recent years. On Monday, the three municipal councils agreed to a joint approach to the new Environmental Act. "A hell of a job," Custers warns, "which you can hardly handle as a relatively small municipality."
In the coming years, Mayor Reg van Loo van Vaals expects joint projects in the field of tourism, social affairs and legal procedures: "If we join forces in those areas, we will ultimately get a better product."
Collaboration is necessary, Custers emphasizes, because the government is shifting more and more tasks to the municipalities. "The work is becoming more complicated," he explains. "That makes small municipalities like ours vulnerable. You often only have one official who deals with such a task. If he fails, you have a problem."
Moreover, those official one-liners have no one to sound off with, Van Loo adds: "It is good if you can occasionally consult with a fellow civil servant who knows the problems inside and out."
<B>Landscape</B>
That sounds like a plea to involve other Heuvelland municipalities in the collaboration. Valkenburg, for example, or Meerssen.
As acting mayor of Gulpen-Wittem, Hans Ubachs once remarked that in the Geuldal itself he could hardly see where his municipality ended and Vaals began. The landscape does not change that much when you drive from Etenaken (Gulpen-Wittem) into Schoonbron (Valkenburg aan de Geul).
However, for Van Loo there is a hard limit. "Valkenburg is different," he notes. "Much busier than our Cittaslow municipalities, where life is a bit slower and the emphasis is more on enjoyment. You may not feel that way in Schin op Geul, but in the center of Valkenburg even more so."
With Valkenburg, the partnership may also become too large, Custers fears: "The three of us have a population of approximately 50,000. According to many experts, that is really a crucial dividing line.
If the size increases, a gap will arise between government and citizens.
We know our residents, and they know us. This allows you as a municipality to provide customized solutions."
