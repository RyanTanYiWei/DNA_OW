Body


Maybe you have already spotted them in Vijfheerenlanden, the people who walk and cycle through the municipality and look up with concentration, as if they are looking for something. They don't do it completely inconspicuously, because they are adorned in orange vests.
The spotters are looking for birds and bats and want to know where these protected animals nest. The search is commissioned by the municipality. If the municipality, a housing association, project developer or private individual wants to build, renovate or make sustainable in a built environment, they will have to deal with the Environment Act. That law prohibits harming these animals - or their habitats.
Measures
Through this ecological research, the municipality maps out where, for example, bats, swifts and house sparrows live. In this way, the municipality can take measures to prevent the killing or injuring of endangered species. If these species are present somewhere, an environmental permit must be applied for.
The municipality describes the research and measures in a plan that is submitted to the province. If it approves the plan, the municipality will receive an area-specific environmental permit.
