MEIERIJSTAD - Just before New Year's Eve, the mayor and aldermen of Meierijstad approved plans for 260 new homes. This concerns larger construction plans in Eerde, Olland, Boerdonk and Nijnsel.
These are the last zoning plans that fall under current legislation. As of the new year, the Spatial Planning Act will disappear and the long-awaited Environmental Act will be introduced. That law bundles about 26 separate laws. There will then be one Environmental Plan for the whole of Meierijstad instead of all separate zoning plans.
Plans still available for inspection
The municipality will make these plans available for inspection in 2023 for the statutory period of six weeks. The handling of views, any changes and final adoption by the municipal council still takes place under the current legislation.
The plans that have been drawn up mainly concern housing projects: 32 homes on Pastoor Smitsstraat in Olland; in Eerde 18 on the Valkenbergstraat and 70 in the Haakakker III plan; 73 homes in the Korstenhof plan in Boerdonk; And in Nijnsel this concerns 20 homes on Sonseweg and 35 on Dahliastraat.
According to councilor Rik Compagne, this will give the housing stock in the municipality 'a strong boost' in 2024.
We welcome all these changes
Colleague Jan van Burgsteden is also pleased with a number of plans that will eliminate intensive livestock farming and demolish stables and greenhouses. This is sometimes replaced by homes or new activities such as daytime activities for people with disabilities or people with dementia. “We welcome all these changes and quality improvements.”
