BERNHEZE - Another change at the top at Lokaal Bernheze. Sander Schaareman will become the new faction leader of the political party. He takes over from Jan Bouwman, who came in for Frans van de Ven in October.
Local Bernheze now announces that Sander Schaareman will become the new group leader for the long term. Schaareman is not completely unknown in that role, because since the new council period he has often acted as deputy chairman.
According to the party, Schaarman characterizes himself as reliable, decisive, straightforward and critical. “We at Lokaal have every confidence in him.”
Permanent committee member on credentials and environmental law
In addition to being a councilor, he is also a permanent member of the Credentials Investigation Committee that screens new candidate council members. He is also a member of the Environmental Act working group. Schaareman lives in Heesch and in daily life is a manager at Hyster-Yale Group, a manufacturer of forklift trucks.
Jan Bouwman immediately stepped in temporarily as party leader in October last year when Frans van de Ven had to resign due to private circumstances. Van de Ven will remain as a councilor and committee member for management and strategy as long as circumstances allow.
