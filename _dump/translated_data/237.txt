Court of Audit investigation into shop vacancy (20/5)
A municipal council's primary task is to develop and test policy. That is why you wonder why the Court of Audit should now lend a helping hand to, among other things, curb shop vacancy.
Retail vacancy is just the tip of the iceberg, I think. First start with thorough knowledge about the spatial structure and how to use it for your own residents.
Then make a realistic estimate of how heavily you can burden the environment with events and visitors, without loss of quality.
I will not accept the excuse that you cannot define quality.
With the new Environmental Act on the horizon and the existing options for anticipating it, quality is something you can work with. In terms of concept (no quality is therefore a breach of the concept) and sustainability (disruption to it is therefore also out of the question) you are legally strong. City residents already asked for this in 2009, instead of continuing spatial policy from the 1990s. Hence!
