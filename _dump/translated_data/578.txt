ABSTRACT
Interview Reinier van Zutphen National Ombudsman
The National Ombudsman fears that the government is increasingly sidelining citizens, now again in the proposed Environmental Act.
COMPLETE TEXT:
         To counterbalance a distrustful government that no longer wants to assist citizens, but regards them as an obstacle. It has now become core business for the National Ombudsman, Reinier van Zutphen.
"You now see it again in the benefits affair, but also in youth care or debt assistance." The essence, he says, is the same: where the government withdrew, through decentralization and cutbacks, distrust against the citizen increased.
"For ten years, citizens have been labeled as fraudsters if they have placed a check mark incorrectly. That still happens. Look at those parents whose childcare allowance was stopped last week in the House of Representatives. They hadn't made a single mistake. And yet they are mistrusted."
         Where does that distrust come from?
"It's not all about the question: who did we do it for again, who are we working for? We have forgotten the citizen in that whole process. It's all about whether the rules have been properly implemented. And how the results are settled in politics."
         Does the problem lie with the politician who makes the policy or the civil servant who implements it?
“It starts at the top of the organization. Tight policy, key figures, speed over expertise. Implementation of the official line, in short. Executive officials are held accountable for this. They apply that strict line again to the citizen, because they have no room to deviate from it."
         Why not?
"Because it is extremely difficult as a politician or manager to say: okay, I trust you. And together we have made it so complicated that you can only make policy based on the greatest common denominator. We used ourselves as a benchmark."
         Who are these 'we'?
“The policymakers, the implementers, even the people here with me. Look at consultation evenings, you see the same group: articulate, well-spoken, people who fit into the systems we have devised. But because of this we are in danger of forgetting groups. That has happened with all previous decentralizations and now we are in danger of repeating that mistake with the Environmental Act."
 From 2021, the Environmental Act must decentralize legislation on spatial planning and environmental policy. The idea: municipalities only set the rules, citizens do the rest. Anyone who needs a permit - for a street party, a cowshed or tree felling - can arrange this themselves.
Citizens and municipalities are far from prepared for this, Van Zutphen noticed. Today he comes up with a list of points of interest based on a tour. "The question is: will the citizen still be served?"
Van Zutphen is not the only one who doubts this. This week, the Senate postponed consideration of the law to 2020, despite great pressure from the ministry to give the green light this year.
         You are early with your doubts.
“I am realistic. This Environmental Act will be introduced, whether it is in 2021, 2022 or 2023. But the pessimist in me says: we're going to have a lot of problems with that. Waiting for complaints is not an option. I see that past mistakes are in danger of being made again. That is why we are already approaching the municipalities."
         Which scenario do you fear?
"We come from a system that says: there is a law, there are rules and we know who enforces them. We are now moving towards a system in which everyone is given the freedom to take the initiative themselves. That sounds very nice, if I can soon install a dormer window without a permit. But if the neighbor isn't happy with that, who's to say if I'm right? Then the government cannot say: 'Everyone can decide that for themselves!'
"There are many people who cannot keep up with that complicated administrative reality of laws, information, consultation and participation - or the lack thereof."
         How big is that group?
,,Big. You often see the idea that those who are self-reliant will be successful. But we see that that group also does not always make it. Look at the homeless, the elderly, people who are not keeping up digitally. These are people we call self-reliant, but who are now also lost in regulations. We have taken away their self-reliance."
         Nobody feels responsible?
"What we see with previous decentralizations is that the withdrawing government is abandoning individuals. The Environmental Act concerns entire groups that can no longer rely on the government. Soon, only the participation elite will be able to participate."
         With decentralization you heard: this brings the government closer to the citizen.
"That was the promise. But municipalities had to do a lot at once. The result: those municipalities organize everything again, in joint arrangements. Then you put the citizen at a distance again.
"At the same time, with the Environmental Act, you feel that the risk of that one wrong check mark is great. Then the government will be there, because that is not allowed."
         That sounds contradictory: a government that is on top of things when a mistake is made, but is absent when the citizen needs it.
"You now give people the space to do it themselves, but not the confidence and information that they will do it properly. If, as a government, you expect a lot from people and give them a lot of space, then you must also support them. Then you can't just look around the corner when someone has made a mistake."
         How can the government fulfill that role?
“By never losing sight of the citizen. Think of a counter official who understands what the citizen needs and offers it. That's not a matter of waiting. Make sure you know who will be affected before you change rules, build or cut down trees. If we do nothing, the government's supporting role is in danger of evaporating."
The pessimist in me says we are going to have a lot of problems with that law
The Environment Act, announced as "the largest legislative operation since 1848", brings together dozens of laws and regulations on the environment and living environment. The law would come into effect in 2021, but the Senate does not yet want to approve it.
