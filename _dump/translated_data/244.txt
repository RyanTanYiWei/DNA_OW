The new Environmental Act makes communication with local residents mandatory, says councilor Carlo Vankan. "But that law is not yet in force," he explains. "And I cannot force anyone to do something that is not necessary under current legislation."
On Wednesday evening, the council committee for urban development once again considered the plans of the Weijts family to expand the Vinkenhof campsite with a number of luxury holiday homes. The current orchard next to the campsite will include tree houses.
Local residents are opposing those plans tooth and nail. Roel and Meggie van der Gouw, owners of restaurant De Aw Geul, are afraid that their company will get into trouble if the business is completely enclosed by the campsite.
Other residents of Schin op Geul and the hamlet of Engwegen also object to the expansion of the campsite. They mainly fear an increase in nuisance, especially after the municipality previously agreed to a renovation of the Schoonbron campsite.
The committee has previously asked councilor Carlo Vankan to start talking again with the various parties and to look for a compromise. That did not work. The Weijts family maintains that they have talked to the neighbors, but they emphatically contradict this.
According to Vankan, the municipality cannot do more. “I advise initiators to consult with the neighborhood. This may prevent you from being confronted with a large number of objections later. But I can't force that."
