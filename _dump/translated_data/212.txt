'Do you want more space for residents' initiatives? Then vote for the VVD," argues Nanda van Doremalen. As a newcomer, she is fifth on the list and will only join the council if her party does well during the elections. “The initiative of residents must be central to Buren. Take the new environmental law. It sounds very boring, but only 20 percent consists of rules. 80 percent is about behavior. That law requires a change in mentality. The municipality is given a new leadership role and must strengthen cooperation and improve communication. I want to use the knowledge I have about this as an entrepreneur as a council member."
