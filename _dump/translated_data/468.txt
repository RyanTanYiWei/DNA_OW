Even the global corona crisis has not thrown a spanner in the works - so far. This conclusion drawn by the provincial government has the pleasant consequence for the merged municipality that the Provincial Executive (GS) is now definitively lifting the imposed 'trustee', at least until 2024. At the beginning of this year, GS had already temporarily discontinued the so-called preventive financial supervision of the municipality. . This means that the municipal council no longer has to submit unplanned expenses to GS for approval in advance. Control and supervision now take place purely afterwards, as usual.
Evidence
Councilor Ton Raven (City Party, Finance) confirms GS's decision. He says he sees this as proof that the municipality has "taken the right path" after years of financial misery. "Our financial position for the coming years is sufficiently strong."
Recommendations
In the 'in-depth study' into the household budget of Sittard-Geleen, the province does provide a number of urgent recommendations. For example, the municipality must keep a close eye on the negative effects of the corona crisis and all related measures. The same applies to the financial impact of decentralization in the social domain. In addition, GS requires extra vigilance with regard to the financial consequences of all kinds of sustainability measures and the introduction of the Environmental Act.
