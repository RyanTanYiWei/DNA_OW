A special bus will soon tour the municipalities of Vaals, Eijsden-Margraten and Gulpen-Wittem to collect ideas for the environmental vision. The municipalities of Eijsden-Margraten, Gulpen-Wittem and Vaals are working on a joint environmental vision in the context of the new Environmental Act. They want to know from residents how they see the future in terms of life, work, housing, recreation and traffic. The so-called Future Bus will visit the municipality of Vaals on March 24, the municipality of Eijsden-Margraten on March 25 and the municipality of Gulpen-Wittem on March 26. Residents are welcome to philosophize about the future while enjoying a snack and a drink. More information about the bus timetable can be found on the municipalities' websites.
