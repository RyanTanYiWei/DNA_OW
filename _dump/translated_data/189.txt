Have you gotten into financial trouble due to corona? Want to smoke more? Want to exercise less? More anxious? Or have a more positive attitude?

This is what the health services in the GGD region Hart voor Brabant ask 95,000 residents of the province during this period.

This week, GGDs in the region will start a large-scale study into the health and lifestyle of adults: the 'GGD Health Meter 2020'. Online or in writing. The investigation runs until December 18.

"Since 2009, the GGDs in Brabant have been conducting uniform questions among residents at the same time. And since 2012, all GGDs in the Netherlands have also been conducting this uniform examination," GGD spokesperson Annelot Tempelmann explains.

The research thus provides information about the health of residents that can be compared regionally and over time. Many questions therefore remain the same every year. "But because the importance of certain topics changes over time, questions are sometimes added or dropped."

For example, according to Tempelmann, information is now relevant regarding the Environmental Act that will come into effect next year and of course the coronavirus. "Precisely to see what impact it has on our lives, we could not ignore corona," researcher Michael Brandt said.

The results will be published in 2021.
