Jeroen Salden has been a member of the Provincial Council of Brabant for D66 since Friday. That in itself is not so special, if it were not for the fact that the native of Breda is only 19 years old.

Den Bosch

In his own words, he is now the youngest representative of the Netherlands. In any case, the Breda politician is the first member of the States of Brabant born in the 21st century. "Yes, there are places that are more flamboyant than the provincial government building," he says. "But I want to give my generation a voice."

Jeroen Salden could immediately start working as a Member of Parliament on Friday afternoon. Shortly after being sworn in, the first-year political science student steps up to the podium in the Statenzaal of the provincial government building in Den Bosch. He takes the seat that until then was occupied by Anne-Marie Spierings, who has become a deputy.

Salden, who is studying at the University of Leiden, will focus on spatial planning, housing and the Environmental Act. "The Provincial Council has a lot of influence and now I have an opportunity to make plans for that."

Over the past two years, the provincial government building in Den Bosch has been dominated by, among other things, protesting farmers and falling coalitions. "It was a turbulent period," Salden notes. "I hope things will become a bit more stable."
