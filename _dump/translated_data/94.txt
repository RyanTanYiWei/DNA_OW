ABSTRACT
           Office language
Also last year, Japke-d. Bouma is again bombarded by her readers with examples of annoying jargon. She made it a top 10.
COMPLETE TEXT:
Every year I think: surely it will be over now, with all that jargon in the office? But every year that turns out to be a vain hope. This year was no different. Because you sent me loads of office words again in 2019! When I read through all the 'itch tweets' from the past year again this week, it made me laugh out loud again (thank you!), but it also made me a little dizzy. Here are the highlights, supplemented with your slang tips on Twitter. Read, enjoy and shudder.
10First of all: the 'journey'. We have known this for some time in marketing, from the 'customer
journey' (which means: the considerations that consumers make before purchasing something). But in 2019 a lot of journeys were added.
Such as the 'employer journey' for employers, the 'student journey' for schoolchildren, the 'candidate journey' for applicants and the 'patient journey' for people in a hospital - everyone had to go on a journey. Do you think it's strange that we have a nitrogen problem in this country?
9 I had never heard of it, but suddenly it was there: 'integrated working'.
Maybe it means: 'doing all the work', instead of doing everything half way. That would be quite an improvement in many companies.
In any case, what it is should be explained more clearly. "Seriously, no one here knows what it means, but it is "a spearhead for us," someone wrote on Twitter.
8 Then: the 'decision tree'. A reader sent it in the sentence: "The welfare bill is not included.
in the decision tree." I think they mean 'decision making', but with trees you can never be completely sure, in terms of proliferation. Is that your decision tree or are you just happy to see me? "The plan is going not through, we just sawed down the decision tree," said a reader on Twitter.
That is of course also possible.
7 Been on the rise for a while, but the 'chief' has become unstoppable in the past year.
The 'lead' who works in a 'squad', on the other hand, is a bit like going backwards. Just like the 'chapters', a name for 'teams'.
Maybe because the Hells Angels are banned everywhere, or because someone found out that the Ku Klux Klan also calls its branches outside the US 'chapters' - you don't know.
In any case, the chiefs are advancing. Such as the 'chief digital transformation officer', the 'chief happiness officer', the 'chief nursing officer', the 'chief cultural diversity officer' and so on.
It is probably no coincidence that more and more companies are calling their departments 'tribes' and having campfire conversations about their 'totem'. I would definitely order tepees for 2020.
6 I looked everywhere in 2019, but the 'course' has disappeared! They are now called 'workshops' (and then
 preferably 'interactive workshops'), 'clinics', 'break-out sessions', 'living labs' (I think with monkeys and mice) but above all 'master classes'.
There are no longer any course leaders, who are now called 'top teachers'.
In any case, I personally love receiving a masterclass from a top teacher. Sounds a lot better than 'listening for 45 minutes to a boring man trying to sell his unnecessary book on 'leadership''.
5 In the past you had 'boosters'. Do you still remember? Such as: the 'booster team for confused people', or the 'booster team for Barneveld tourists'.
But because no one was still moving, 'pullers' were devised in 2019 to drag people to work by the hair.
For example, last year I read about 'enthusiastic theme leaders', about 'programme leaders', 'agenda leaders', about 'programme leaders' (that was called 'labbekakken' in my time).
But there were also regular 'tractors', and I don't mean those on the Malieveld or on the highway. No, 'pullers' are people, and sometimes they have to pull hard. By the way, that's called 'traction': how big is your traction?
A reader wrote: "Our innovation project has pillars, those pillars have drivers and under those pillars there are foundations."
Phew, get on it!
4 You used to call someone on your phone. Nowadays you 'make a call'.
Someone said that to me in 2019: "I can't talk to you for long because I have to make a call." When I laughed very hard at that, it turned out that she had meant it seriously.
I always call it the 'English disease': speaking English when it is not necessary at all. And many people suffered from this again in 2019.
For example, I was inundated with 'save the dates' (because tomorrow the world will end), with 'calls to actions' (don't shout like that), and many people wanted to 'meet' with me 'face to face' (no, no and still a cut).
Furthermore, the word “nice” made a huge splash in 2019, as in “I have a new job” – “NICE!” Many people on LinkedIn also thought that I had 'shined' and 'challenged' in my presentations. I had really 'sliced, nailed and owned' it (cry).
And then of course there were a lot of people last year who called their email 'traffic', wanted to 'improve their social skills' and 'change their mindset'.
  But I thought the epitome of unnecessary English was this: "Why didn't you mention that in the meeting?"
It gives me a pointhead.
3 Then the chain. Man, you couldn't turn your back in 2019 or there would be a rusted chain somewhere.
Such as the 'order chain' and the 'customer chain'. But I also came across 'lineless chain care', 'chain integration', 'overview of information chains', 'focus on the chain - both decentralized and central' - and of course 'the integral chain': a kind of overarching dungeon where we all all in prison.
And then I almost forgot the 'integral, chain-wide progress report', which I of course devoured from cover to cover.
Dear people, throw off your chains in 2020!
2 But what really left a bad taste in my mouth was 'the aftertaste'.
I had already been warned about this expression at the beginning of this year, but you wrote to me that you nevertheless continued to hear 'the aftertaste' more and more often in the office.
 For example, when colleagues ask you if you would like to 'share' your 'aftertaste' of a meeting or conference with them. Share your aftertaste?! How? In a French kiss?!
I have of course checked for you whether this phrase might have something to do with alcohol. But even that turned out not to be the case. So get rid of it. That really is better for everyone.
1 But the undisputed slang highlight of 2019 was of course 'the deep dive' or the 'deep dive session' (with wrong spaces).
I had heard him before, but he only really struck me through Marcel Canoy's book about Rabobank, which stated that management regularly takes employees 'into a deep dive into the why'. You'll just work there.
What it means? Well, just: 'thorough research'. But apparently this has become so exceptional in so many companies that a separate - of course English - word has been invented for it.
What I find craziest about the deep dive is that deep diving is quite dangerous: every diver knows that. Because the deeper you go, the greater the 'nitrogen narcosis' - you start to speak gibberish, do strange things and can no longer think coherently. These are the kinds of things you often see during a deep dive, but I don't think they are really the intention.
I can therefore inform you that from 2020 all deep dives are prohibited, especially those of thirty meters or deeper, and I hope that we will all stay on the surface more often in the new year.
That's what most deep dives remained anyway.
The only question left is how we are going to survive all the jargon in the coming year. I don't know a solution for that at the moment, other than using earplugs, laughing out loud about it and continuing to ask what it means. "If you stick 'in your panties' behind every itchy word in your mind, every working day is a party," wrote one of my readers - but you don't get that from me. See you in 2020 and have fun under the decision tree!
Often heard in the office: whether you want to 'share' your 'aftertaste'. Share your aftertaste?! How? In a French kiss?!
Someone told me: 'I have to make a call soon.' When I laughed really hard, it turned out to be serious
These were the best job titles of 2019
            3
The 'team leader of substantive matters' (now a 'team leader of useless matters' and we can move on)
           2
The 'strategic clarity coordinator' (works closely with the 'strategic clarity coordinator')
           1
The 'circular professional' (someone who keeps going around in circles); the 'business continuity manager' (finally: someone who keeps things running!); the 'task accent holder' (I think someone from Brabant); the 'integral improvement coach' (who also immediately does the MOT of your car, I suspect) and the 'regional manager of line-free chain care' (who falls under the 'CEO of line pulling').
These were the worst 'meetings' in 2019
           3
The 'harvest dialogue' ('get the combine out of the grease,' someone responded on Twitter)
           2
The 'cohesion moment' (a meeting where everyone is stuck together with adhesive tape)
           1
The 'interactive substantiation breakfast' (the wattes?), the 'wind tunnel session' (a club of windbreakers with open doors), the 'consultation meeting' (yo), the 'workfield catch-up meeting' (can I leave this?) and my personal favorite: 'the deflation session ' (Delicious).
And these were the biggest slang tigers of 2019
           3
The municipality of Den Helder, which wrote the following in a PowerPoint: "Neighborhood-oriented work means that we visit and have a view of natural sites", and: "We provide integral access with a broad request."
Anyone?
           2
The province of Flevoland wrote that they would "actively focus on #sustainability and #innovation" together at the new Lelystad airport.
Sustainability! When you open an airport. You just have to dare.
           1
But the undisputed number 1 was of course the Ministry of the Interior, which launched a 'plain language campaign' in 2019 but nevertheless posted a vacancy with dry eyes for a 'Interface Manager for Strategic Management Organization for the Digital System of the Environment Act'. Humour. That's right.
