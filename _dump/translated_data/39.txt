Highlight: Just a month ago, Berg en Dal proudly presented a balanced budget for 2020. But it has now become apparent that the municipality still has to make a significant contribution from its savings pot.
Body


This concerns an amount of 765,000 euros for the introduction of the Environmental Act. To make matters worse, councilor Nelson Verheul issued a 'profit warning' last week because the ODRN (formerly building and housing supervision) is short of money and that will cost Berg en Dal an extra 148,000 euros in 2020.

Politics Berg en Dal feels overwhelmed by the hold on reserves. Especially because the budget for 2020 has to be adopted tomorrow and the bottom of the treasury is slowly coming into view. Politicians believe that these costs were foreseeable and that money should have been found in the budget (cutting spending or increasing taxes) instead of tapping into the piggy bank. "Residents have the right to an honest picture of the financial position of their municipality," the council said.

The Environmental Act will come into effect on January 1, 2021. The law replaces 26 current laws when it comes to the living environment of citizens. Consider the Spatial Planning Act, the General Provisions of the Environmental Act, also known as the WABO and the Environmental Management Act. From January 1, 2012, permits (in practice mainly construction) must be processed on the basis of this new law. That costs money. The IT part (software) in particular is expensive, according to the municipality.
