Don't ask how it is possible, but take advantage of it. In the municipality of Sint Anthonis, the time required to process a permit has decreased significantly.

While the process was slow a few years ago, it is now almost lightning fast. Three years ago, a regular permit application under the Environmental Act or Wabo still took 87 days. That is now only 60 days.

In the past, when applying for complex permits - such as for an agricultural company - the processing time was up to 531 days. The average duration now required is only 151 days. The acceleration has also been achieved while, or perhaps because, more permits have been processed. How is that possible? By thoroughly examining the licensing process. and simplify. Just as the Japanese company Toyota achieved success in its early years by working much more efficiently. By slimming down processes, we gained speed. That also happened in Sint Anthonis. At the request of the municipal council, officials reviewed the permit process. By redesigning this, the lead time was reduced.
