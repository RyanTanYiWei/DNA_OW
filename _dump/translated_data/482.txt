Job van der Meer

Beuningen

Cobussen is from Beuningen Nu & Morgen, the party that became the largest with six seats in the municipal elections in March this year. De Ewijkenaar has been in the municipal council for twelve years and was party leader in the elections. He takes the place of outgoing councilor Piet de Klein, who has been councilor for the past twelve years. Cobussen will have housing, sustainability and public space in its portfolio.

D66 member Alwin Steeg succeeds councilor Hans Driessen. The born and bred Beuningen resident receives sports, education, finance and economics. A range of tasks that fits in with his work as an accountant and as an assistant referee in professional football.

Frans Houben (GroenLinks) has been an alderman for the past two years and is responsible for healthcare, work and income, and participation policy. The PvdA also does not change its councilor. Sijmen Versluijs continues to work on spatial planning and environmental law.
