The municipality of Nederweert has found three suitable members to form a new, temporary heritage committee.
The old committee was honorably dismissed in March at its own request after an unworkable situation arose due to a breach of trust with then councilor Ria Stienen. The Heritage Act requires municipalities to have an advisory committee for monuments. But on January 1, the Environmental Act will come into effect, which bundles various laws. Then the requirements that a Heritage Committee must meet will change, the Municipal Executive writes in a letter to the municipal council. Nederweert is still working on a new heritage policy to safeguard local knowledge and expertise in the future. The new heritage committee is therefore appointed to bridge the period until the new legislation.
The committee consists of three members who, according to B and W, are sufficiently qualified for this. They currently also form the monument committee of the municipality of Leudal. Nederweert has also called on their expertise where necessary in recent months.
