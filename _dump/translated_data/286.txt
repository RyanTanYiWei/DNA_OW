The government must pay more attention, including when granting permits. This is what the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) says in the report 'Care for the landscape', which is being presented today. According to the PBL, the Dutch landscape has changed significantly over the past thirty years. The available land is increasingly being built up and the number of onshore wind turbines has increased from two hundred in 1990 to more than two thousand in 2019. The number of large solar parks has also quadrupled in two years. "Citizens are concerned about the disappearance of openness, views and trees," the researchers write. 'And about the increase in the number of wind turbines, solar parks and distribution and data boxes.' According to the PBL, the landscape is often a final item in government policy, resulting in the landscape fragmenting. Characteristic ditches and hedgerows have disappeared.
Until 2012, the Netherlands still had a national landscape policy, but this came to an end under the Rutte-1 cabinet. The Ministry of the Interior is now working on a new environmental law: the PBL calls for stricter landscape rules to be included. The PBL also recommends creating a 'shell' around the national parks in the Netherlands with different natural and cultural landscapes.
