Which buildings characterize Geldermalsen's identity? Are there areas that cry out for a quality boost and where is residents' own initiative possible? These are questions that architects, councilors and residents of Geldermalsen will consider.
Tomorrow the renewal of the welfare policy will be discussed in the town hall. The Gelders Society will hold an introductory presentation at 7:30 PM. Council members and other interested parties will then discuss the matter.
In particular, the arrival of the Environmental Act, which is expected to come into effect in 2018, requires an update of the aesthetic policy document. The Environmental Act provides more room for citizens' initiatives. We then look more at the possibilities rather than at what is allowed according to the rules. The Environmental Act assumes that municipalities need fewer rules to maintain control. This deregulation fits in with Geldermalsen's vision, who recently proposed scrapping some rules.
The municipality is also considering including the advertising policy in the aesthetic note.
