Construction will soon be possible in the Heuvelland by relaxing national legislation. "We were already allowed to build a little more," says councilor Wiel Dreessen of Eijsden-Margraten, "but now we can finally do that."
Housing construction in the Heuvelland had virtually come to a standstill for years because the municipalities themselves had put the brakes on it, for fear of vacancy. The municipalities recently revoked those restrictions.
In practice, however, it sometimes takes six months to a year before a building permit can be issued. That has a huge slowing effect, Dreessen notes.
Now that Minister Kajsa Ollongren has announced that the new Environmental Act will be introduced on January 1, 2022 - "Finally", sighs Dreessen - these procedures will be considerably shortened.
