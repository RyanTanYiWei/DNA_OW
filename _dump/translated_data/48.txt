There are at least sixty laws and measures that regulate spatial planning. As of January 1, 2021, there is only one left: the Environmental Act.

The councilors of the municipality of Beuningen will now prepare for this new law, says councilor Piet de Klein of spatial planning. "We start from the existing zoning plans and ask the question: where can it be done differently and, above all, easier?"

According to him, the starting point of the new law is the principle 'yes, provided'. A development must be possible provided a number of conditions are met. Another principle is that the decision period is drastically shortened. “That goes to eight weeks. Now that is six to nine months," says De Klein. The new law also obliges residents who want something different with their home or business to involve their environment.

It sounds abstract, and it is. And the councilor hints that he also has to see whether things will improve, as the government intends. According to him, it is all the more important that council members think carefully about their own 'environmental vision'. This is then also worked out in detailed plans for spatial planning. "Within the current zoning plans, it is sometimes unclear what is allowed," the councilor says. This needs to become clearer. And preferably with fewer rather than more rules.
