Too many hotel rooms in the city (9/7)
I don't think you can sleep a wink in Maastricht anymore as a hotel operator.
If you have just agreed on a clear policy, exceptions start flying around your head. This municipality governs through ad hoc policy.
Dynamics, new market concepts and niches should of course always be possible. I might still think so, but not if we can always fall back on renting out to regular hotel guests. This adds 378 rooms directly to the existing excess capacity.
I recently woke up with the following idea: fight the church with your own weapons. The Council of State is increasingly clear in its recent case law. Breaking the concept (hotel note) and harming sustainability (too much of the same undermines the existing situation) are very valid arguments for doing so. to put a stop to the arbitrariness of a municipality.
Then you don't have to wait for the Environmental Act (in 2016), in which the municipality will have to very carefully refute the arguments of citizens if it wants to be allowed to proceed with plans.
