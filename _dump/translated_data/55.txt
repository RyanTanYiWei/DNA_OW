The construction of thirty homes next to and in the H. Antonius Abtkerk in Malden will not start for the time being. During an initial investigation in the parsonage garden, so many archaeological traces were found that much more digging will have to be done.

"Then you are also talking about things from Roman times and before," says Jeroen van den Adel, owner of project developer AdVicus. "A few hundred square meters have to be uncovered. If we are lucky, based on the project, they don't find anything that is really important. Or maybe it is just necessary to properly map the tracks. In the worst case, there is something really special and we have to adjust the construction plan, for example."

It is still unclear when the more extensive excavation work will take place. Van den Adel hopes to have the historical investigators up and running 'as soon as possible'. It is certain that valuable time is lost. “I hope that we can really start building this year. The market is good."

AdVicus previously hoped to start construction in 2023. Coordination with greening plans that the municipality of Heumen has with Kerkplein, among other things, caused delays. AdVicus and Heumen do not yet agree on the distribution of the costs of water management around the current church building and the new construction.

Another uncertain factor: the new Environmental Act came into effect on January 1, which means that the municipality and developer must go through new procedures. It is unclear whether this will cause delays.
