Rob Brouwers will remain in office as village architect in Gulpen-Wittem for the time being. In this capacity, he assesses building plans that are submitted to the municipality. This is arranged differently in the Environmental Act that the House of Representatives is preparing. However, the introduction of that law has already been postponed several times. It is still unclear when it will actually come into effect. Until then, the municipality's contract with Brouwers continues. Brouwers is an architect at the Satijn agency.
