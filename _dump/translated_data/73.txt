Highlight: The municipal councils of Neder-Betuwe and Buren will talk and consult with each other more often about matters that mutually affect them.
Body


That was the conclusion of a meeting in Ommeren, where the municipal councils got to know each other and together they delved into the consequences of the new Environmental Act.

Both the new Lower Betuwe mayor Jan Kottelenberg and his Buren colleague Jan de Boer noted that it is good and useful to speak to each other more often. Kottelenberg promised to organize the next joint meeting in Neder-Betuwe. Unlike Geldermalsen, Neerijnen and Lingewaal, neither Buren (26,000 inhabitants) nor Neder-Betuwe (23,000) have ambitions for a municipal merger. But Gelderland commissioner Clemens Cornielje has urged both municipalities for close cooperation.
Avenue tree cultivation
The neighboring municipalities of Buren and Neder-Betuwe already work together in many areas.

Including when it comes to the further development of the avenue tree sector, which is of great importance in both municipalities. This also concerns direct cooperation (for example the implementation of the Participation Act) or as part of a larger partnership (for example in the Rivierenland Region). Both councils believe it is very important for their own municipality that this collaboration is successful.
