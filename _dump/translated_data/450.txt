THE NETHERLANDS
The Netherlands has more than 1,300 partnerships in which municipalities work together. That number has increased by 17 percent since 2017. On average there are 33 per municipality: from public health (GGD), environment (Environmental Service) and safety (Safety Region) to social investigation, social care, labor market policy, archiving obligations and retail.

The number of partnerships per municipality varies considerably per province. In Limburg the average is 52, in Overijssel 34, in Gelderland 32 and in Flevoland 26. Friesland is at the bottom with an average of 23.

Many municipalities also work together with municipalities in another province, such as Zeewolde in Flevoland with Gelderland municipalities such as Harderwijk and Ermelo, West Overijssel municipalities with municipalities in Gelderland (such as Hattem, Heerde and Oldebroek) and Mook and Middelaar in Limburg with municipalities from the Arnhem/Nijmegen region in Gelderland.

Those 1300 partnerships are already a lot, but there will be many more. In recent years, tasks such as the Youth Act/youth care, Participation Act and Social Support Act (Wmo) have already been added to the responsibility of municipalities, but the new and far-reaching Environment Act, the consequences of climate change, energy transition, major housing construction tasks and numerous other tasks have been added. Most municipalities simply cannot manage this due to a lack of knowledge and capacity. Usually there is a separate collaboration for each topic.

The number of people working for joint schemes has increased from 26,250 in 2009 to 47,012 in 2019. In the same period, the number of people working for municipalities fell from 177,133 to 153,668.
