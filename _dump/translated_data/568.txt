The housing plan in Molenhoek-Zuid must be treated as a priority. This is the opinion of the mayor and aldermen, which wants to speed up because the new Environmental Act could cause delays next year.

If all goes well, the construction of the 250 homes in Molenhoek-Zuid can start in 2024. That has been taking long enough, says councilor Gertjan Wienhoven of the municipality of Mook en Middelaar, given the enormous need for houses. The council therefore wants the necessary procedures to be completed as quickly as possible and Wienhoven is also appealing to the municipal council.

According to the plans, the new residential area, with 250 homes, should be located in the area between the Maas, the Rijksweg, the railway and the Bredeweg. Part of the territory is owned by the municipality, the rest is owned by three developers. The intention is that half of the planned homes will be affordable for young people and starters.
