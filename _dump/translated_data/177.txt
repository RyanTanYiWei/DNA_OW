MEIERIJSTAD - The settlement with the government for 2023 shows that Meierijstad will receive more than 4 million euros more than had been expected. It is also clear that almost 1.8 million euros more will be spent this year, B and W wrote to the municipal council.
The general government benefit is based on various principles. A number of amounts to which municipalities are entitled are based on fixed tasks that are carried out. For example, there are contributions for the reception of Ukrainian refugees, youth care, guidance for status holders and costs incurred for the introduction of the new Environmental Act.
At the end of the bill, Meierijstad appears to be entitled to more than 5 million euros for last year. More than 1 million euros of this cannot be spent freely, but it is determined how it should be spent; earmarked. This includes, among other things, the Environmental Act and care for Ukrainians and status holders.
The council wants to temporarily add the remainder of the millions to the general reserve, so that it can be determined this year whether the extra funds are needed for certain tasks. The council wants to have that discussion when the framework memorandum is presented.
