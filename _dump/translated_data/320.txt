Wanted: people who give their opinion on what should or should not happen in their neighborhood in the future. Environmental association Land van Cuijk wants to find them and make it clear that it is better to have your say before the 'concrete truck enters your street', as Geert Verstegen of the organization puts it.

The reason is the new Environmental Act that is coming up and in which residents can indicate their wishes and concerns. But then you have to do that. “They have to seize that opportunity. We want to give them the tools.'' Tools in the form of information. "It's important to know what you're talking about."

In four meetings, residents of the Land van Cuijk will be informed about future developments. The first - over water - is Thursday, October 21 (8 p.m., Jachthoorn in Sint Hubert). In the months that follow, information evenings about health, energy and agriculture and nature are on the programme.

The environmental association wants to create a map of all the comments collected that it will present to the new municipality of Land van Cuijk before the summer. This should show at a glance what residents are concerned about and where they see areas for improvement.

The meetings are organized by the environmental association, but it does invite guest speakers. The water board will of course be present at the first round. Attention is paid, among other things, to the quality and capriciousness of water and its management. The GGD is present at the second health meeting (November).
