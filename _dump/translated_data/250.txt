The municipality of Gulpen-Wittem will digitize the inventory of cultural heritage. This is necessary to be able to properly incorporate it into the new Environmental Act, explains councilor Jos Last.

It is therefore important that the information about this is up to date, says Last, and will soon be anchored in the new legislation.
