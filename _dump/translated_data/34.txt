 INVESTMENT AGENDA
BROOK
The property tax (ozb) in Beek must increase by 7.9 percent in 2020. The Beek council submits this proposal to the municipal council. It is one of the measures needed to balance the multi-year budget.
The multi-year budget 2020-2023 presented to the municipal council is balanced, just like in previous years. That took some effort, because a cutback of 1.9 million euros had to be processed. Almost all portfolios have contributed to achieving this. "Difficult choices were not avoided," the council said.
Most striking measures: abolition of leaf baskets (which results in savings of 10,000 euros per year), a new subsidy system (savings of 25,000 euros in 2021) and increasing the property tax for homes by 7.9 percent. The latter yields an additional 233,300 euros annually in the municipal treasury. According to councilor Ralph Diederen, Beek still remains the municipality with the lowest housing costs in the Western Mining Region.
This is partly because adjustments in waste policy lead to less burden on citizens.
In addition to cutting costs, the municipality of Beek also wants to create room for investments. In view of major expenditure for the next four years in the social domain, energy and climate, environmental law and shrinkage, the council proposes to make 1.3 million available in the budget, so that there is room to implement a strategic investment agenda. to make. This allows projects to be put on track that improve the quality of life and attractiveness of Beek. Concrete examples of projects cannot yet be mentioned, but population decline and aging and related housing construction and facilities will be subjects for investments.
In the coming four-year period, 250,000 euros will be reserved for an investment agenda in the first year and 350,000 euros in the following three years. The multi-year budget 2020-2023 will be discussed during the council meeting of November 7.
