Formateur Hans Martijn Ostendorp already advised last week to form a coalition of the three parties mentioned. Subsequently, a study was conducted into the aldermen to be nominated. Kok, Te Lindert, Groters and Wikkerink have 'passed the balloting'.

Newcomer Groters worked at water company Vitens. De Dinxperloër is in a relationship and is the father of three children. As the new councilor, he will be responsible for public space, citizen participation and the environmental law.

Councilors Hans te Lindert and Joop Wikkering will be responsible for the so-called social domain. Ted Kok will do finance and spatial planning.
