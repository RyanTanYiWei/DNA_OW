On the way to Valhalla (12/6) Maastricht on the way to Valhalla, unlimited and relaxed, our 'wise politicians' have been brooding for many weeks on a pink cloud to create heaven on - Maastricht - earth. Now let's talk common sense, back to some actual facts. 1. Maastricht CS is not a terminal station, but as a through international junction, then the tram to Hasselt (which does not go over the Spoorbrug to CS) is still a poor line. 2. The bridges have to be raised to finally realize that international shipping route (with higher container traffic) via a very expensive lock at Ternraai. 3. Soon there will be more hotel rooms than student rooms. 4.
Increasing internet shopping makes the proposed string of shops, from the Center via Sphinx/Belvedere, (Loods 5 is not a walking route) to the Bosscherveld, into a farce and the expansion of the Brusselse Poort is becoming a low point. 5. Get rid of gas by 2030. Incomprehensibly, new gas pipelines are currently being installed en masse in various neighborhoods. Directly in a heating network would be much more sustainable. It is also surprising that the Environmental Act 2021 contains no guarantees compared to surrounding countries/regions.
Will the next four years be a fairytale or will it be a deception?
