Hubert Mackus (CDA), deputy for agriculture and former councilor in Nederweert, would like to once again point out improvements that he believes have been made within livestock farming in the field of the environment and quality of life.
He mentions, among other things, advances in the field of odor and ammonia.
Mackus acknowledges that particulate matter emissions are still a problem in Nederweert. According to him, the new Environmental Act will offer options from 2019 to manage particulate matter.
Mackus sees no point in reducing the numbers of animals that some are pushing to reduce the nuisance caused by livestock farming. "I don't think the number of animals is an issue.
We must strive for a win-win situation."
According to Mackus, it is not a point of discussion that, for example, the situation surrounding particulate matter emissions needs to improve. “You have to see that as a dot on the horizon. The discussion focuses on the speed at which this should happen." In his view, a number of bottlenecks will disappear automatically in the future, partly because a number of companies will close down.
