Many legal changes take effect at the start of a new year, including in 2024. Which rules have changed from Monday? An overview of the most important changes as of January 1, 2024.
Public health, Welfare and Sport
- E-cigarettes with flavors such as tompouce and cherries will be banned. This should make the so-called vapes less attractive to young people.
- The Nutri-Score will become the official quality mark that should help people make healthy choices when they buy food. Participation by manufacturers is voluntary. But if they choose to provide one product with this quality mark, then all other products must also do so.
- The tax on non-alcoholic drinks, including soft drinks and non-alcoholic beer, will increase from 8.83 to 26.13 euros per 100 liters. Mineral water is exempt from this tax.
Home Affairs
- The prices of rental properties (independent homes, studios and apartments) in the private sector may increase by a maximum of 5.5 percent.
- Municipalities will be given more powers to give priority to their own residents, people with specific professions or other groups if they want to rent a house or buy a new-build home (for a maximum of 390,000 euros).
- More people can use the National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) when they buy a house. The maximum permitted home value to make use of this will increase from 405,000 to 435,000 euros. The NHG is a safety net for homeowners who are faced with falling house prices, financial problems or forced sale.
- Several mortgage rules are being adjusted. This way, people can borrow more if they buy an energy-efficient home or if they choose to become more sustainable. In addition, parents can no longer give their children a tax-free amount to buy a home with. The so-called jubelton had already been reduced to almost 29,000 euros and is now being abolished completely.
- The environmental law, which is much discussed in politics, will come into effect from 1 January. The enormous law bundles a large number of laws, rules and regulations regarding the physical environment. In addition, the law provides a single digital counter for applying for permits and starting projects.
Justice and Security
- Doxing, or the intentional sharing of personal data to intimidate someone, will become a punishable offense. There is a penalty of up to two years in prison or a fine of up to 22,500 euros. Doxing is often aimed at, for example, journalists, politicians, judges, police officers or care providers. Doxing someone without a specific profession also falls under this law.
- It will be possible to give children both the surname of the father and the mother. Children born after January 1, 2016 can also receive a combined surname, provided they are the eldest child in the family. It is not mandatory to give a child a combined surname. If no choice is made, the child will receive the mother's surname if the parents are not married or registered partners. If the parents are married or registered partners, the child will receive the father's surname.
- Mayors can close a home if there is serious violence, such as shootings or explosions. There was already the option to close homes in the event of serious behavior by the residents, but this was not always sufficient.
This year there is an extra tax on products that contain a lot of sugar, how does that work? (video):
- A number of financial arrangements are also changing. For example, court fees will be reduced by 13.5 percent. Anyone who wants to take a case to court or has to defend himself must pay court fees. Furthermore, the statutory interest rate will increase from 6 to 7 percent. For example, citizens with debts pay interest if they do not pay their debts. There will also be a so-called disadvantage compensation. If citizens or companies suffer more from legitimate government actions than others, they will be compensated for the additional damage.
- The fine rate for minor traffic violations will increase by 10 percent.
- Tougher action can be taken against the abuse and neglect of animals thanks to stricter rules. For example, companies can be closed more quickly for this reason.
Infrastructure and Water Management
- Disposable plastic cups and containers (completely or partially) are banned in catering establishments, events, offices, institutions, associations and sports clubs. The rules are not being strictly enforced for the time being after many critical voices in the House of Representatives.
Education, Culture and Science
- High school students are no longer allowed to take their smartphones into class. This is not a legal ban but a measure that schools themselves have agreed to. Mobile phones may be used if it adds value to the lesson.
- Graduates see the interest on their student loans rise from 0.46 to 2.56 percent. Not every former student will immediately have to deal with this fivefold increase. The interest on student loans is always fixed for five years. Those who are lucky with the timing can still pay the low interest rate for five years.
