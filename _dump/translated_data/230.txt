Light the wood-burning stove if the online Heating Guide advises against this? The question is whether this will still be allowed in Nijmegen. The city council wants to investigate whether a burning ban can apply and submit this to the municipal council. However, there are doubts: how feasible is it?

"We are already doing a lot to prevent wood burning," says councilor Tobias van Elferen (D66). "There was no option yet to impose such a ban. That is changing. We would like to investigate this. "

The councilor responds to questions from, among others, GroenLinks councilor Abdulahi Hussen. Together with the Nijmegen factions of SP, D66 and Party for the Animals, he calls for a ban on burning wood if the Stookwijzer turns red or orange. The guide advises on heating based on air quality and wind speed. If it is orange or red, it is advisable to leave the heater off.

The parties want a ban on burning with these codes. Until now this was legally unfeasible. From January 1, 2024, this can be arranged via the Environmental Act.

Nijmegen likes to investigate it, says Van Elferen. The city council does see bottlenecks in costs and feasibility. "Enforcers should not have to guess where the air comes from."

There are now demolition premiums if residents remove their stove or make it more sustainable, and 'responsible heating' workshops. The plan is for a proposal to be submitted to the municipal council about a ban.

Hussen is happy with it. "I understand the doubts. That is precisely the reason we want this investigation."
