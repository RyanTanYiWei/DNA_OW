How do West Maas and Walers see the future of the village in which they live? And what should be maintained or improved? The municipal council submits a questionnaire to residents.

The new Environmental Act will come into effect on July 1, 2023. This law replaces 26 laws that currently determine what is and is not permitted in the areas of building, environment, water, spatial planning and nature. For example, the new law will soon make it easier and quicker to apply for a building permit.

An environmental vision is required for the Environmental Act. This vision describes developments in public space. Every new plan will soon be tested against this.

By completing the questionnaire, West Maas and Walers can give their opinion on eleven themes from the environmental vision. "The vision is about the future of all of us," says councilor Ans Mol. "That is why the input from residents and entrepreneurs is essential."

Another meeting will be held in each village in the spring, the councilor says. "The vision will be presented to the city council around the summer."

The questionnaire is on the municipality's website and can be completed until mid-January.
