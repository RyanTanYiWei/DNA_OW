This is what Arnhemmer Peter Wildschut argues in a letter to the municipal council. According to Wildschut, next year the municipality will be able to use the new environmental law to designate prominent points in the city that must not be affected.

Height 80, between the Monnikenhuizen and Geitenkamp districts, is part of this, according to the Arnhemmer. He previously drew the attention of local politicians to the construction of eleven new homes on Dominee Bechtlaan in Monnikenhuizen, the height of which appears to affect the striking view from Height 80.

Wildschut believes that the council has not had sufficient opportunity to ensure that the builder would comply with its assignment to protect the view from Height 80. In its opinion, the council should have informed the council again when the project developer decided not to deepen the construction of the houses.

“The municipality employs specialized civil servants who advise the council. Shouldn't it be necessary for all council members to have training as instructors and surveyors to check the figures on the documents submitted?" Wildschut states in his letter.

De Arnhemmer suggests that the city council involve residents in the question of which beautiful places should be preserved. Tonight the issue of the view from Height 80 will be discussed in the city council.
