For the first time in a few years, Eijsden-Margraten's annual accounts show a plus.
Last year, the presentation of the municipality's framework memorandum and annual accounts was a big blow: Eijsden-Margraten lost 1.2 million euros in the budget. This year there is a positive balance. The annual accounts are over 580,000 euros plus. The general reserve, the municipality's savings pot, has increased from 7.1 million to 7.8 million.
Social domain
Especially in the social domain, things are looking a bit brighter than expected. This is partly due to the fact that the government's contribution has been higher for all municipalities and because Eijsden-Margraten made significant cuts last year.
For the time being, the corona crisis has a double effect on the household budget. Although the crisis has caused additional costs - from extra communication to setting up support programs - on the other hand, things that would otherwise have cost money did not happen. There were fewer events. Fewer subsidies have been paid out and fewer contributions paid to, for example, childcare and living room projects that were closed. Fewer external workers have been hired internally and, for example, courses and training have not taken place.
Delay
Another sip on a drink: the environmental law will only be introduced later. However, Eijsden-Margraten must take into account that a number of the latter items will return at some point.
Windfalls also included the fact that significantly more environmental permits and driving licenses were applied for, which resulted in more fee income and higher income from tourist tax than expected.
