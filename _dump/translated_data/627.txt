Living in the city center is 'hot', we want to speed up. That's what they said two years ago at Synchroon about the BK40 housing plan for the Bartok Park in the city center of Arnhem. But the procedures prove to be tough and sticky. The project developer from Woerden is now aiming for 2024.

"It is exciting to see whether that will work, but we are heading towards it," says Margriet Huisman, responsible for BK40 at Synchroon. "We have not been sitting still lately and have actually made a few steps forward, but we are not there yet."

Synchroon wanted a building with 55 apartments on the spot where Florentijn Hofman's Feestaardvarken became famous. A permanent place has now been found for the statue in Park Sonsbeek, and plan BK40 has been adjusted following comments from local residents. For example, there will be an entrance to Theater aan de Rijn.

This does have consequences for the number of homes. The current plan has five town houses and a building with 51 apartments and a bicycle shed. This was, just like corona, one of the reasons for the delay.

Synchroon wants to soon sit down with parties such as De Groen, Loft, Rozet and Theater aan de Rijn, who have previously been critical of the plans for the Bartok Park and even came up with their own idea. The feasibility of the plan must then be examined. Furthermore, it is impossible to say what consequences the lack of clarity surrounding the new Environmental Act may have. That law would be introduced on January 1, but that is still uncertain.
