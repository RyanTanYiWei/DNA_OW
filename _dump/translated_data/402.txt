Nederweert closed 2021 with a positive financial result of 1,513,555 euros. That amount does not flow to the general reserve, but is used for new policy.
At least that is the proposal of the new municipal executive, which the council will consider on July 5. Nederweert ended the corona year 2021 almost twice as well as the year before. A positive result of 868,618 euros was then recorded.
The B and W propose to divide the 1.5 million that now remains over four subjects, in order to arrive at a starting budget for the new council period 2022-2026.
The aim is to set aside €400,000 for the Positive Health project. The aim is not only to promote a healthy lifestyle, but also to tackle the underlying causes of unhealthy situations.
Another €400,000 is set aside for economic development. Consideration is given to upgrading industrial estates and creating good connections between the center and Lambertushof, among others. Four hundred thousand euros will also be donated to the Buitengebied in Balans project. The aim is to help farmers with innovations and finding new revenue models. There will also be more attention for (agricultural) nature management.
The remaining 313,555 euros must go to the municipal organization. New legislation and regulations require many adjustments to the working method, for example for the introduction of the Environmental Act.
How exactly the funds will be used will be detailed in the 2023 Budget, which will be submitted to the council in November.
Nederweert ended 2021 almost twice as well as the year before. The municipality was then left with 868,618 euros.
