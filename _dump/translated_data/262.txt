Highlight: TopParken will stop renting jacuzzis at holiday homes. The company, which mainly has holiday parks on the Veluwe, had to make that decision because it cannot guarantee the quality of the water.

'We encounter all kinds of things in the water, from alcohol to semen and feces'

"Unfortunately, we can no longer meet the legal requirements," says manager Bénédicte Lammers of TopParken.

According to Lammers, the blame lies with the consumer. The demands placed on rented jacuzzis were already high. Before a new tenant moves into the holiday home, the water is changed. "We also have to test twice a day for all kinds of values, to determine, for example, whether extra chlorine needs to be added."

And that's where things go wrong. Lammers: "Guests do not handle the use of the jacuzzis properly. If people don't shower before going into the water...

During these interim checks, things are found that do not belong in the water. "You have people who go in with sunburn on their bodies." But that is the least serious example. Lammers: “We have found everything in the water. From feces to semen and alcohol.”
Empty the entire bath
According to Lammers, TopParken is obliged to empty and clean the entire pool in the event of such a discovery. “And we don't have the staff for that at the moment. In the current labor market it is not possible to get enough people for this. Moreover, costs would then increase. For us, the most important thing is that we cannot meet the requirements and that we cannot guarantee public health. That is why we are stopping the rental of jacuzzis at all parks in the Netherlands."

The reason for the increased alertness at TopParken is an inspection visit from the province of Gelderland in the context of the Hygiene and Safety Act for bathing establishments and swimming facilities. "We have urgently requested better management," says provincial spokesperson Tim van den Brink. "Apparently Topparken has now concluded that compliance with legal requirements does not seem feasible."

TopParken has twelve parks in the Netherlands, the majority of which are in Gelderland. There are a total of almost two hundred jacuzzis in those parks. The hot tubs are very popular, says Lammers. "They are always well booked. We will leave them for the time being, because the private owners of the houses also own the hot tubs. And they can use it when they are in their own house."

Affected holidaymakers are offered a discount by TopParken. If they do not want to use this, they can cancel their reservation free of charge. TopParken hopes that changing regulations will make rental easier again in the future. The Environmental Act will be introduced in the Netherlands on July 1, 2022, and the current inspections of jacuzzis will no longer be included, Van den Brink confirms.

Landal GreenParks has announced that it sees no reason to stop renting the popular jacuzzis. "We check the quality of the water according to the rules and we are not aware of any incidents," says spokesperson Jeannette ten Kate-Winter. "The jacuzzis are very popular."
