Highlight: Lighting the wood stove may soon be prohibited in Nijmegen if the air quality outside is moderate or poor and there is not enough wind. Municipal councilors want to further limit wood burning. It should, among other things, combat respiratory complaints.
Body


GroenLinks councilor Abdulahi Hussen and fellow party member Jasmijn Kraaijeveld initiated questions for the city council. Together with the Nijmegen factions of SP, D66 and Party for the Animals, together accounting for a political majority, they are asking for a ban on burning if the Stookwijzer turns red or orange.

The online Heating Guide of the Living Environment Information Point continuously provides heating advice per zip code. If it is red or orange, it is advisable to leave the heater off.

Such advice does not go far enough for the Nijmegen municipal council members. They want a local ban on burning with the latter codes.

Until now this was legally unfeasible. From January 1, 2024, this could be arranged via the Environmental Act, which will then come into effect. In this way, Amersfoort is introducing a similar ban.
