"For example, in Saroleastraat there is a shop with a nice apartment above it. But without a separate entrance, so it cannot be rented out. Such an adjustment can be quickly arranged," says councilor Loek Damen (Spatial Planning, Elderly Party). Another example: an address with one house number, while there are three separate homes. Creating two additional house numbers does not have to take unnecessarily long. "These are small things, but something like this helps to promote living above shops," says Damen.
He indicates that the municipality regularly meets with housing associations and other property owners to discuss these types of aspects.
Private individuals who, for example, want to convert a shop in the center into a home can always contact him. "Within the possibilities of the Environmental Act, we will then look at how we can meet such a demand."
The CDA believes that the council can step up its game and is calling for a fund from which building owners can receive a contribution for expensive renovation. The municipality should also hire someone who actively seeks out property owners. The proposal is to conduct a test in Saroleastraat. In response, Damen says he will leave the initiative to the market. He points out that the theme will be discussed extensively in the City Plan, which is expected to be submitted to the council in March or April.
