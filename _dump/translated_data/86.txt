The municipality of Urk has issued the first two permits based on the new Environmental Act, which came into effect in January this year. One of these was about renovating and expanding the Red Cross building. Councilor Willem Foppen personally presented this.
The social function of the Red Cross building in Urk continues. On the ground floor there are plans to realize day care for the elderly and childcare. There are plans for a general practice on the first floor.
The existing main building is being renovated and an extension is being built at the rear. The idea is to give the building a facelift while maintaining its social function. Research has been carried out into the cultural-historical value of the existing buildings. As a result, the municipal executive decided to put the characteristic building on its own monument list.
environmental code
Renovating a house, organizing an event or installing a warehouse: all situations in which you will have to deal with the Environmental Act. From January 2024, this new Environmental Act will combine old laws and regulations in the field of the living environment. The idea is to gain an overview of the plans of municipalities, provinces, water boards and the government in one digital counter.
The other environmental permit under the new system has been granted for the construction of a detached house in the Zeeheldenwijk on Piet Hein Allee.
