Danikerberg
During the protest with candles, Danikerberg looks like a cemetery (29/12)
In the narrow part of the Danikerberg nature reserve, wedged between the A76 highway, an urbanized area and Chemelot, the Natuurmonumenten association plans to make 18 of the 21 hectares available to the company Natuurbegraven Nederland BV. First of all: I have no objection to a natural cemetery. But not in this place, where many people from Geleen, Sittard, Beekdaelen and surrounding municipalities enjoy recreation. Only three hectares remain for recreation, only because these three hectares are not suitable as a natural cemetery. The commercial organization wants to create no fewer than 6,000 natural graves here. On average, a natural grave costs 5,000 euros. So this is a revenue model that gives Natuurmonumenten some fat on its bones. The Danikerberg is located on the territory of the municipality of Beekdaelen. How is it possible that you do not inform the neighboring municipality(s) of these far-reaching plans? The Beekdaelen municipal council must approve the plans under the Environmental Act. Although the municipality of Beekdaelen profiles itself as a green municipality, it completely misses the point when it agrees to this plan.
