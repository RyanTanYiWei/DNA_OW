GroenLinks in Renkum does not want paramotors to fly from the floodplains into the Rosandepolder and near Doorwerth. The party has included this in the program for the upcoming municipal elections. GroenLinks is now also asking the council for additional regulations that should make it easier to refuse a permit.

The latter is necessary because the court in Arnhem ruled in favor of paraglider Jacques Bechthold from Oosterbeek when he objected to the withdrawal of a permit in 2016. The municipality of Renkum believed that it was not authorized to make a decision about flying with a motorized paraglider from the floodplains. For that reason, she revoked a previously granted permit.

Wrongly, the court ruled. Which means that Bechthold will submit a new application for this year. "At least for the area next to the old brick factory in Doorwerth. Trucks drive back and forth there every day, so they cannot possibly use the status of a nature reserve as a counterargument. I am considering canceling my application for the Rosandepolder. Based on this statement, I also expect to be allowed to fly there, but there is a lot of resistance among local residents in that area. I'll have to think about that some more.”

GroenLinks emphasizes the Environmental Act. This makes it possible for municipalities to take additional measures in nature reserves, specifically to combat noise pollution. "More than 200 people have objected to the fly. We want peace in nature, no flying mopeds," says Henk Boon on behalf of GroenLinks.
