The environmental law is coming. As a result, the municipality of Land van Cuijk will draw up an environmental vision. In that vision, the participation of residents can be important. That is why the Land van Cuijk Environmental Association is holding four lectures to inform residents. The second lecture on health will take place on February 9 at 7:30 PM in the Jachthoorn in Sint Hubert. You can register via ambientwet@mlvc.nl
