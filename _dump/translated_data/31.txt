A resident of Batenburg is allowed to keep horses in a barn near his house. The municipality of Wijchen initially prohibited this because it did not fit in with the zoning plan.

Batenburg

It concerns a house on Wethouder Bankenstraat, north of Batenburg. The resident would like to house eight horses in a barn near the house. This concerns three of our own horses and five horses from other owners.

The municipality initially prohibited the stables of horses, because the entire plot is zoned 'residential'. The resident then started talking to the municipal council again. It has decided to apply 'customization'.

The resident will receive a two-year permit, because the storage is mainly for hobby purposes and has few spatial consequences. The municipality is thus anticipating the new environmental law, which offers more options.

The Batenburger must meet a number of conditions. For example, no new buildings may be built and the number of traffic movements may only grow to a limited extent.
