ROERMOND
Citizen participation the norm, not for form. Under that motto, the Roermond Spatial Foundation is organizing a debate on Monday.
Central question: when do you involve citizens in (construction) plans in their environment? According to the foundation, the arrival of the Environmental Act and the council elections are a good reason to 'explore the Roermond situation together'.
The evening takes place in the Herteheym community center in Herten and starts at half past seven.
