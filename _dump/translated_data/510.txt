 ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN
MAASTRICHT
Future developments of Boschpoort must pay special attention to the green character of the district, meeting places and any nuisance from nearby industry.
This is evident from an initial sketch that the municipality of Maastricht has made for a new environmental plan for the neighborhood. With the introduction of the Environmental Act, all existing zoning plans will be incorporated into one environmental plan in 2021.
Boschpoort is being treated as a pilot in Maastricht. Residents of Boschpoort are involved in the planning process. They particularly point out the green character of the neighborhood. There should be more cycling and walking routes, for example with a new walking bridge over the Connecting Canal to the Grensmaas area and a passage over the weir. The former sports parks could be transformed into a neighborhood park.
The area around the Towpath, the basketball court and the spillway area are considered unsafe and could use a makeover.
There should be more meeting opportunities, for example during events or in the neighborhood park. Residents would welcome the arrival of a health center. They also want close attention to environmental standards regarding air quality, water quality, odor and noise pollution.
The Bosscherweg should be made safer and public transport optimized.
The municipality states that it is good to make room for these matters in the new environmental plan, but wants to avoid disappointment: "The environmental plan is not the document that frees up resources and capacity to realize certain developments."
