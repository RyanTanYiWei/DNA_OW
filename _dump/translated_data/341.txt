The municipality of Aalten will have a new council with two CDA aldermen, a representative of GemeenteBelangen and one of the Progressive Party (PP). This was confirmed last night during a council meeting.

The councilors have not yet been announced. But it is expected that it will concern current councilors Ted Kok and Hans te Lindert on behalf of the CDA and Joop Wikkerink on behalf of PP. This concerns a total of 3.7 jobs. An extension compared to the old college. According to formateur Hans Martijn Ostendorp and the intended coalition parties, this is necessary because the municipality faces many 'complicated topics'. In the areas of healthcare, education, the Environmental Act and regional cooperation.

The BBB-HMV faction felt sidelined by the formateur. "We never had a fair chance," said spokesperson Margo ten Bruin. “We are the big winner of the elections. The voter wanted to give us a chance, apparently you didn't. I am surprised and disappointed. The mayor recently sent an email in which he shared his concerns about the involvement of residents in politics. For us that is very simple. Listen to the voter, but we were sidelined in no time."

According to CDA member Raimond Smit, the criticism is unjustified. "We have a number of positions where we are too far apart. It is very simple for us." Alex Walter of Gemeentebelangen understood the disappointment at BBB-HMV. "But politics is also how you can bring parties together. That is what happened in this case."
