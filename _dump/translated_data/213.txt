Body


Ester Weststeijn starts this week as mayor of the castle village
Rozendaal wants to be a modern municipality, a 'Rozendaal 2.0'. The city council was looking for a mayor to match that ambition. The choice fell on Ester Weststeijn, a non-party municipal official from Delft. The city council hopes for her 'young and lively contribution'. Weststeijn starts on Thursday in Rozendaal, the village where she once went to the Rhedens Lyceum. Now her children can grow up and go to school there, while she 'learns the trade'.

When did you think: I want to wear a chain of office?

Weststeijn: "As a sixteen-year-old I sometimes joked: I want to become the first female Prime Minister of the Netherlands. But as a dual job, because an 80-hour working week seemed too much to me. I had an interest in public affairs from an early age. I have always worked at or for the government. That's never going to change. But I don't have a neat party political career, like many other mayors do."

You are not a party member?

"No, I felt that I could not be a spokesperson for B&W and a councilor in the neighboring municipality. I was a member of the Delft audit office to do something for my own municipality."

You were recently group controller in Pijnacker-Nootdorp. What does that function entail?

"You are the eyes and ears of the management and you ask yourself: are we doing things right at the municipality? And also: are we doing the right things? Questions you can also ask as mayor. I find being active in public administration important, fascinating and varied. Especially in municipalities. They are close to the residents. You can do that as a civil servant and as a director. I already knew the administrative side. Now I am going to experience the administrative side."

Won't you also become a Rozendaal official?

“In a way, yes. But only with respect for everyone's place within the municipality. Administrative responsibility is ultimately different from official responsibility. I shouldn't sit in the town manager's seat. But I do know a lot about business operations. I also assume that I will answer press questions and write speeches myself."

You have young children. In addition to being a mother, do you also want to become a proverbial citizen mother?

“My eldest is over three, the youngest is less than a year old. We take them to the shelter at the Village School. Meeting the Rozendalers on the schoolyard is fine. Gladly even. Although there will undoubtedly be times when I have to say: let's talk more at a later time."

How are you going to get to know the Rozendalers?

“Starting with the official reception on Thursday. I plan to be clearly visible at the polling station on March 20 during the elections for the Provincial Council and the water board. And I hope to meet many Rozendalers, whether it is at an official occasion or at school or in a shop. I am also considering holding thematic discussion tables."

Are you also going to the meeting point for the Rozendalers, the paper container on Saturday?

“I've heard about that. I just have the feeling that I will be taking away the waste paper more often and will be taking more time to do so than is strictly necessary."

Why not choose an official residence?

"There is currently no official residence, only a financial reserve for it. My partner and I bought a house ourselves. We want to bond with the municipality and the community. We send that signal. I want to be mayor here for at least six years. We are staying for a longer period.

"We're moving before Easter. In Delft we now live in the city center. Nice for a couple who both have busy jobs. But children cannot play outside. I give my children greenery and space around them. Living in Rozendaal is a wonderful coincidence. Close to my parents in the Achterhoek. And living in the area where I feel at home because of my high school years. How beautiful can it be, right? My grandfather and grandmother lived on the Rozendaal side of Velp. I often went there in between hours."

That's why you chose Rozendaal?

“I wouldn't have been able to become mayor anywhere else. On the one hand, out of modesty because I have not been mayor before. Rozendaal is a place where I can learn that. On the other hand, because of those childhood memories. I am not a career mayor, and it is not yet a certainty for me that this will remain my profession. It often happens to me that after seven years in a job I start to get the itch. That's very normal in careers these days."

Aren't you afraid that Rozendaal will quickly become boring for you?

"I'm not hearing that question for the first time. I'm honestly not afraid of it. I can't imagine it in the short term. Whether you are mayor of Amsterdam or Rozendaal, you have the same tasks and obligations, such as with the energy transition and the Environmental Act. Although the tasks in Rozendaal are sometimes simpler, it is your turn as a municipality."

Are you not afraid of becoming a museum spokesperson for that quaint, chic Rozendaal that often makes it to Quote or Elsevier?

"You shouldn't hide the fact that Rozendaal is special. You can be proud of 200 years of independence. If others are interested, I'm more likely to welcome them with open arms than to wave them away. Regardless: Rozendaal is a village where people simply live and live and where the municipality must carry out its tasks. A special village. That attracts attention."
