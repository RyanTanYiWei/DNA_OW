The organization Platform31 is trying out new plan forms on behalf of the government, together with the municipality, with fewer and more flexible rules.
 This is an experiment in anticipation of a new national Environmental Act.
 Through this experiment, Platform31 investigates to what extent flexibility contributes to more initiative.
 Laan 1945 in Weurt has been designated as a test area.
 The so-called invitation planning policy must entice residents and entrepreneurs to take new initiatives.
 This year two working groups started working. Both consist of six involved Weurten residents.
 New plans are not completely rule-free. The people of Weurten formulate some guidelines.
 A city council committee will discuss the rule changes tonight.
 The flexible zoning plan will probably only apply from the end of 2015.
