Residents of Roerdalen can contribute ideas about the municipality's environmental vision. They can indicate what they consider important via a digital questionnaire. The investigation will continue until May 15. You can think along via the website www.roerdalen.nl/visie-op-roerdalen.
In the environmental vision, the municipality sets out its long-term ambitions for the living environment. The vision concerns all areas of the living environment, including nature, landscape, traffic and transport. The environmental vision therefore replaces other policy documents, such as the structural vision and housing vision. The vision forms the basis for the other plans from the environmental law that the municipality must develop. A first version should be ready by the end of 2020. Councilor Jan Smits: "The environmental vision is about the future of Roerdalen. We would like to determine this together with our residents, entrepreneurs and associations." The municipality uses the digital questionnaire when drawing up the environmental vision. Meetings will be organized later this year for the follow-up process, where the vision can be discussed.
