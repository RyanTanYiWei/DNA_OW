Highlight: Youp and Riet Cretier's canopy on their vineyard in Dieren may remain in place for at least another two years. And perhaps much longer. The latter is in any case the intention of the Rheden municipal council.
Body


The roof had to be removed because the cultural-historical committee of the municipality of Rheden did not consider the construction method to be appropriate for the Hof te Dieren national monument, of which the vineyard is part. The poles that support the roof are placed in wine barrels filled with concrete. That is why the Cretiers had not applied for a building permit. This is not a building, they reasoned.

Ultimately, they decided to capitulate and apply for a building permit for a new roof. Then the city council took action. Was it really necessary to make the life of a Dierense entrepreneur who is important for local tourism miserable during corona times? While that hood is not visible from the road?

D66 and Christian Union came up with a ruse. The Cretiers' building application is being processed, but the couple may wait two years before building. This creates a legal situation where the old hood can remain in place.

All this in anticipation of the new Environmental Act, which offers municipalities the opportunity to take more account of their function when assessing buildings. "We will of course have to wait and see whether that assessment of our old hood turns out well," says Riet Cretier. "But this first step is a good one."
Political parties ensure that Youp and Riet Cretier do not have to demolish anything in the first few years
