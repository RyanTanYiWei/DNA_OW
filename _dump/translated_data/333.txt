Body


With the introduction of a new Environmental Act, Neder-Betuwe wants to know from its residents what they consider to be of great value to their living environment and what action is needed to strengthen the quality of their village.

Councilor Nees van Wolfswinkel hoped for a response of 15 percent, but a municipal spokesperson was slightly more cautious yesterday. "We are now at 6.5 percent, 10 percent would be nice."

The cards have been filled in with great dedication. “The entire map is being filled up. There is an old-fashioned white border around the card. Wishes and suggestions are even noted there.

“We type all the texts into a file. We are working on that for a while. The submission period was supposed to close on Monday, but the deadline has been extended. We will still send one to anyone who did not receive a card, for example because they have the 'no-no sticker' on their letterbox. People can also email us.”
