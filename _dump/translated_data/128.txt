Tomorrow, Echt-Susteren will continue looking for the answer to the question of what the municipality should look like in 2040. The opinion of residents is expressly requested for this.
Many municipalities have started the process of developing a so-called Environmental Vision some time ago and have sometimes already completed it. Echt-Susteren is now focusing on the future and is organizing meetings for residents. The input must lead to a document that broadly describes what the physical environment will look like in 2040. In the context of the Environmental Act, which comes into effect on January 1, every municipality must draw up such a vision. The law should lead to simpler rules regarding living space.
Meetings were already held in January in which existing policy, regulations and trends were inventoried. Now it's the residents' turn. During three sessions - in Maria Hoop, Echt and Roosteren - residents can discuss current themes, such as living, working, nature development, climate, energy and club life. The individual centers are visited after the summer. Schools are actively involved in the process. This way, students in groups 7 and 8 can think creatively about the future of Echt-Susteren.
