Residents living near construction plans sometimes feel that they have no say, and that is bad for confidence in the government. The municipality of Wijchen now wants to do something about this.

Wijchen

It sometimes happens that neighbors of a new construction project approach the government with concern, the municipality of Wijchen has noticed. What's going to happen? And what do you as a resident have to say about it? Sometimes it is even too late, while residents expect the municipality to stand up for them.

Whether it is justified or not, dissatisfaction sometimes damages citizens' confidence in the government. Wijchen therefore wants to ensure that citizens are better informed. A plan for this is now ready for local politicians: they will discuss it for the first time on September 14. The idea is that Wijchen residents should be able to discuss plans as early as possible.

To answer questions, civil servants will, for example, more often attend information evenings about construction plans. Anyone who wants to build something in the municipality is encouraged to involve local residents in the plans.

A more subtle change is that Wijchen deletes the term 'decision in principle': it gives the impression that everything has already been decided. This changes into: 'a decision to cooperate in principle based on a quick scan of policy, regulations, and spatial frameworks'.

The changes are related to the introduction of the Environmental Act, which should make spatial rules simpler.
