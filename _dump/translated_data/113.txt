ABSTRACT
Nature conservation report
Bat research can delay construction, which became clear at the Veerhuis in Rotterdam. The conversion into a writers' house by Droom en Daad was delayed by a year by one bat.
COMPLETE TEXT:
The sun is shining in the Rotterdam Schiehaven. Wearing reinforced boots and a white helmet, director Wim Pijbes of the Droom en Daad foundation strides across the construction site. Specialized construction workers are working on the renovation of a monumental ferry house. Eighties music blares from the construction radio, occasionally interrupted by the screeching sound of a cross-cut saw.
Anyone who often renovates monuments knows: under every stone and behind every plank there can be a gigantic and project-threatening problem. Yet this time it was not the monument legislation, the specialist type of paint or the aesthetic committee that gave Pijbes sleepless nights, but the presence of one common pipistrelle bat.
In his work boots, Pijbes climbs onto a dump container to pull a black brush from the facade. "Almost two thousand of these have been installed. An ecologist has been busy for a few days. They were in every crack and under every roof tile. Crazy if you ask me - I think we will encounter these things even after delivery."
After years of vacancy, the Veerhuis had become a ruin, but it will soon become a drop-in center where everyone is welcome who wants to do something with writing in one way or another. The renovation should have been finished a long time ago, but because of that one bat, work was halted for at least a year. Pijbes estimates the additional costs at around 100,000 euros. “That is not just for the ecologist. But also the extra meetings, the materials, the time in which we had to secure the house. You name it."
Thorough ecological research
The Council of State recently ruled that homeowners must first carry out a thorough ecological investigation into the presence of bats before they are allowed to carry out work on their facade. A camera investigation is not sufficient. The ruling was seen as a victory for nature conservationists and ecologists, who see facade insulation as the biggest threat to the bat population in the Netherlands.
But not everyone is equally enthusiastic. With the experience of the bat in the Veerhuis, Pijbes draws a different conclusion. "There are so many laws, regulations and authorities to take into account. I also did the renovation of the Rijksmuseum, but this house really beats everything. The relationship is really lost here."
More than a hundred years ago, Rotterdam residents commuted from the RDM harbor, where the house is located, to Kortenoord, on the other side of the Nieuwe Maas. The house has been empty in recent decades and has deteriorated. The timber frame was visible, and the light driftstone of the walls showed large holes. Droom en Daad, the foundation through which the wealthy Van der Vorm family undertakes social projects in Rotterdam, purchased the ferry house in 2021.
Until recently, the house was on the municipal demolition list. When Droom en Daad indicated in 2017 that it wanted to build a public writing facility on that site, a historical foundation stipulated that the building should not be demolished but restored.
Before the work could start, an ecological study had to be carried out. "That investigation is required by law, and we of course adhere to it," said Pijbes. And that's where the trouble started. The ecological inspection showed that there was a common pipistrelle bat in the dilapidated spring house - the most common bat species in the Netherlands .
And as soon as the presence of such a bat is established, every project developer knows: this will take a lot of time. First, so-called 'mitigation measures' must be taken. New roosts must therefore be arranged so that the bat can live somewhere else. Actively chasing away the bat is not allowed; the animal must find another home on its own initiative.
"Look there." Pijbes points to a corner of the construction site, where there is a rack with bat boxes. "We had to hang those boxes, while there are also trees around here." Pijbes looks at it somewhat disparagingly. "I have no idea if a bat has ever sat in it - if I were a bat I would rather sit in that tree."
And then the waiting began. Due to the breeding season and hibernation, during which bats have different roosts, it can only be determined after seven months to a year whether the bat is actually gone. After a few months the ecologist returned. All holes in the dilapidated house were checked by the ecologist and provided with black brushes. Exclusion flaps were also introduced, special hatches that allow a bat to exit but not enter.
While the work could not start, the structural condition of the Veerhuis rapidly deteriorated. The site was hit by a rat plague, the building was broken into twice by intruders and a February storm damaged the roof.
Pijbes shows photos of the storm damage. “We were lucky. Because it has no value, the property could not be insured. If something or someone had been hit by a flying roof tile, we would have been liable."
After a few months, the ecologist was able to determine that the bat was no longer there, so the renovation could finally start. The building is now covered in scaffolding and has been cordoned off.
Pijbes repeatedly emphasizes that he has nothing against bats and nature conservation, but that he believes the nature legislation regarding bats is overshooting the mark. "We want to preserve a monument here, and that is frustrated and held up by nature legislation. When you see what all that research and all the measures have cost in time, work and money - without us knowing whether that bat has ever been back at all."
“I am very much in favor of nature conservation, but it must be in proportion. And when I see here that we are trying to save one specimen of the most common bat with all these costs and efforts, then I think: this is disproportionate. Penny wise, pound foolish.”
Species management plan
The solution may already be available at the province of Utrecht: the species management plan, or SMP for short. According to this working method, not the citizens, but the municipalities, apply for an exemption from the province if they want to insulate or renovate - which everyone in the municipality can use.
The species management plan is seen as a promising solution. To such an extent that the highest administrative court even mentioned the SMP by name in its judgment.
An accelerated version of the SMP can even be used under a number of conditions. If the municipality takes action to map all bat colony habitats on a large scale, an exemption can be issued for certain parts of the municipality so that insulation or renovation can begin there.
Interest in the policy plans behind the SMP has increased significantly since the ruling. In the province of Utrecht, which has been working according to this method for six years, the responsible officials are inundated with questions. To answer everything, coordinator Wendy van Poppel organized an online consultation hour for her colleagues in other provinces. With success: four provinces want to introduce the method before the end of this year, while others are considering it. "I also receive many calls from municipalities all over the country that are ready to get started," says Van Poppel.
The government recently made 44 million euros available to provinces so that they can put the species management plans into practice. If this had happened earlier, the Veerhuis could have been renovated much earlier under an exemption that applies throughout Rotterdam.
environmental code
Although it is a practical solution, Pijbes wants to address a more general and larger problem. "You can see it with this project: there is a lot of legislation and regulations in the Netherlands. And that has not, as politicians say, become much less in recent years - but rather more complex and fine-grained. They also increasingly contradict each other. In current practice, you often solve this by choosing the law most favorable to you and explaining it well."
Pijbes sees potential problems, especially in the introduction of the Environmental Act, which bundles Dutch legislation and regulations on spatial planning. While a decision can currently be justified with a specific law, this will no longer be possible with the introduction of the Environmental Act, he fears. “Then everything came together. I really foresee that the Environmental Act will create all kinds of paradoxical problems with partial laws that contradict each other. And that only makes building more difficult. If you have a monumental building that needs to be renovated and a bat is found: congratulations and good luck."
