Through measurements, ecologist Jaap Schröder shows that the soil of the Veluwe has become as acidic as vinegar (De Gelderlander, January 31). Acidification is everywhere in the Netherlands, but in the Veluwe it is very bad, causing major damage to the water and nature.

It is due to the large nitrogen 'blanket' that has covered our country for years, despite the denial by populist parties. I also noticed this acidification through measurements in the soil moisture during research for the RIVM in the 1980s on the NW Veluwe.

Although the province of Gelderland is very familiar with this pollution, it has done nothing about it over the past forty years. The tap for the ammonia and nitrogen precipitation remained open.

Even more unfortunate, however, is that organizations - IVN, Landschapsbeheer Gelderland, Natuur en Milieu Gelderland - that are trying to save some of nature are now being drastically cut by the province (Gelderlander, January 31).

It yields little for a province that has 2 billion in its account, but it is the death blow for the organizations. While they are also organizations that work with many volunteers involved in nature and the environment. This is now called citizen participation in the Environmental Act. Surely you can only see that as an attempt to stifle the last critical voices in a democracy?

The expression 'Gelderland provides you with beautiful regions' sounds very sour!

Gerrit Krajenbrink, De Heurne
