ETTEN-LEUR - It is becoming more expensive to build a house. This has to do with a new law and the passing on of costs to the owner. In Etten-Leur the amounts are between 700 and more than 4,000 euros.
You have always paid a certain amount for the municipality's costs (hours, research and planning damage), and on top of that are the local facilities. This involves the construction of new infrastructure, but also nature compensation and recreational facilities.

You have always paid a certain amount for those regional facilities, but with the entry into force of the new Environmental Act on January 1 and an expansion of the so-called cost recovery, some additional costs will be incurred. For a social rental home it is approximately 700 euros (total costs) and for a more expensive owner-occupied home you pay 4,200 euros.
Although you pay these costs everywhere, they are not the same in all municipalities. The amount depends on various factors. The calculation system is the same everywhere. In Etten-Leur it has been decided to make it clear to builders in advance what the costs will be.
