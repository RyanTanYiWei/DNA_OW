The municipality of Voorne aan Zee wants to keep control over the future destination of the Helvoet rubber factory in the heart of Hellevoetsluis. To this end, she wants to have the so-called pre-emptive right recorded, which means that the area must first be offered to the municipality when sold.
The new Environmental Act helps Voorne aan Zee to take more control over land acquisition, for a period of three years for the time being. Councilor Igor Bal (VVD) told the city council that he is in discussions with Helvoet Rubber & Plastic Technologies, but that there are no concrete plans for the site yet. The company has been there since 1939.
"It is an important area for us, where the A Capella and Vermaat projects are also located. The question remains of course: should you still want a factory with heavy industry in the center? We are still working on that,” said Bal. He stressed that no offer has been made. “That is premature, we are not yet in negotiations.”
Odd man out
The councilor received support from fellow party member Dick Bosgieter, who called Helvoet an 'odd man out' for the area. After all, the company is surrounded by homes and retail. It is not known whether there is contamination of the soil, which Anneke Witte (Vrij Voorne) asked about.
The municipal council must still have the pre-emptive right officially recorded.
