From next year, it will no longer be necessary to apply for a permit to install a scaffolding or container outside the center of Maastricht. The permit requirement for placing a food truck at a private party or hanging temporary signage for tours and walking tours will also be abolished. Containers and scaffolding only need to be reported. The condition is that they do not get in anyone's way and do not hinder passage.
With this measure, the municipality of Maastricht - in anticipation of the introduction of the Environmental Act - wants to reduce the regulatory burden for residents and companies.
"In the coming years we want to look across the board to see where it can be done easier and faster," said Alderman for Permits Vivianne Heijnen. "This is a first step in the right direction and immediately leads to lower costs and less hassle for users. "
