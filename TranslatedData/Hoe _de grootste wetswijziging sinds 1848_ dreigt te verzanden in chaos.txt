Body


On January 1, a law came into effect that concerns the renovation of your house up to the expansion of an airport: the Environmental Act. In the past you had to deal with dozens of laws and different counters. But now you can control everything in one place, at the touch of a button. That sounds ideal, but editor Jos Verlaan sees how good intentions seem to get bogged down in chaos.
