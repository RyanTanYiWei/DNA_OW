THE HAGUE - The use of patio heaters should be restricted as much as possible in The Hague. This is the opinion of the Party for the Animals and GroenLinks, who submit written questions to the city council. "We expect people to insulate their homes, but terraces don't even have walls and are still heated. Let's stop heating the outside air," says party leader Robert Barker of the Party for the Animals. Barker and Arjen Kapteijns of GroenLinks point to the Environmental Act that can be used to limit the use of patio heaters.
