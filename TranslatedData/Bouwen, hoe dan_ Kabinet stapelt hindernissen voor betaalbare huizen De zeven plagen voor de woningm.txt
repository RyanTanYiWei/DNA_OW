Rutte III wants to put an end to the housing crisis by building more, but at the same time he wants to be 'the greenest cabinet ever'. Regulatory drift, sky-high ambitions and fiscal interventions slow down the road to more affordable housing. De Telegraaf lists the seven plagues for the housing market.
1. PFAS malaise
After soil contamination by a sprinkler system in a hangar at Schiphol and incidents at chemical company Chemours in Dordrecht, research is being conducted into the danger of a group of thousands of chemical substances. There are no environmental regulations for these Per- and PolyFluoroAlkyl Substances (PFAS). They appear to occur throughout the country, some of which are said to be dangerous to public health. Responsible D66 State Secretary Stientje van Veldhoven (Infrastructure) pressed the alarm button in the spring of 2019. She comes up with temporary rules with very strict standards. The RIVM warns of the practical consequences, but Van Veldhoven perseveres.

The consequences are enormous: gardeners, dredgers, builders and earthmoving can no longer move a grain of sand in many places. Construction is immediately in danger. In the summer, companies sound the alarm. VVD MP Erik Ziengs makes it political, but the minister is stuck with policy language. Only when the Malieveld is full of angry entrepreneurs and the pressure on the cabinet is maximum, Van Veldhoven intervenes.
There will be studies based on measurement data. Experts see what the construction sector already thought: the standards can be safely relaxed. More is now allowed, but the financial damage is enormous. The State Secretary apologized last February during a parliamentary debate: “We could have done things better.”
2. Nitrogen crisis
It has been almost fifteen years since Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman started labeling more than 160 nature reserves with 'Natura2000'. Hardly anyone seems to realize that the European rules to protect nature can lead to a nitrogen disaster. When farmers and construction get into massive trouble with permits, CDA MP Ger Koopmans and PvdA MP Diederik Samsom come up with a solution to prevent a crisis: the Programmatic Approach to Nitrogen (PAS).
Applicants for a nature permit can now build with the promise of nitrogen reduction in the future. The latter did not always happen, much to the annoyance of the environmental lobby. After years of struggle, they reached a court decision in the spring of 2019: the PAS may no longer be used with immediate effect. Farmers, builders and activities that require a nature permit are experiencing acute problems.

Minister Carola Schouten (Agriculture) is faced with a crisis that Prime Minister Mark Rutte described in November as the biggest in his career as Prime Minister. The CU minister first takes her time. The coalition parties quarreled from the start. D66 wants to halve the livestock herd. That is non-negotiable for VVD, CDA and CU. The approach that follows consists of numerous compromises. The Netherlands is now on lockdown and has been stuck on the highway several times due to unprecedented farmers' protests.
The minimal nitrogen gain resulting from the reduction of the maximum speed from 130 to 100 kilometers per hour during the day provides a little space to build houses. The first permits will be issued soon.
3. Clean Air Agreement
The European standard for clean air is not ambitious enough, according to D66 State Secretary Stientje van Veldhoven, responsible for environmental policy. She wants an even stricter approach. With her 'Clean Air Agreement' - an agreement with nine provinces and 36 municipalities - she bypasses the business community that has to deal with the major consequences.
For example, it has been agreed that there will be additional requirements in the tender for construction projects. A company with 'clean' equipment is given priority and 'construction hubs' are needed on the outskirts of cities, from which materials must be transported. Construction companies fear higher costs, a patchwork of different rules and, above all, delays in housing construction.
Although not all provinces and municipalities support the Clean Air Agreement, national policy is not yet off the table. The latest nitrogen advice from the Remkes committee also addresses additional requirements in the tender. The government has yet to respond to this part of the advice.
4. Sound rules
Due to new calculation rules for noise, housing construction is once again in danger of becoming more restricted. They are part of the Environmental Act. From 2022, this law will replace hundreds of rules and laws in the field of the living environment. Everything must become simpler and more balanced.
At least that is what D66 Minister Ollongren (Home Affairs) intends. But that is precisely where the problem lies with the new calculation rules. In addition to the law, State Secretary Van Veldhoven (D66) has decided to adjust the rules for calculating noise. The precise details of the new calculation do not need to be approved by parliament.
But the new calculation would have a completely different outcome in parts of the Netherlands compared to now. While the noise factor is currently still 'reasonable', the same area may soon be classified as 'very poor' due to the new rules. A disaster for municipalities that have plans for housing in those areas and annoying for people who want to sell their house there. Stakeholders fear that housing construction will fall even further into the doldrums.
Experts are already comparing the issue to the legal nitrogen crisis and the PFAS malaise. The call to prevent a new tragedy is great. “Maintain existing regulations for noise standards. Then we can continue solving the growing housing shortage without additional obstacles," says Ruben Heezen of Bouwend Nederland.
5. Mortgages
Due to stricter mortgage rules, it has become more difficult for first-time buyers to buy a house in recent years. With the best intentions, the government has made it possible to allow parents to donate more tax-free to help their child make the first purchase. Practical problem: mom and dad must be wealthy enough for such a gift or private loan.

This summer, Minister Wopke Hoekstra (Finance) surprised the real estate world with more flexible mortgage standards for dual-income couples. In simple language: the second income will count more, so people can borrow more. De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) warns: over the past 25 years, additional borrowing space has translated into higher house prices. What will the government do?
6. Proper building materials
Minister Ollongren says that the correct building materials are not always used. She therefore insists on promoting 'circular construction'. That means building with materials that can be reused.
The minister wants to quickly impose on the construction sector that construction must be done with such materials. Since 2018, a minimum 'environmental performance requirement' has been included in the building regulations. This requirement forces construction parties to build more circularly. This requirement will be tightened in 2021 and by 2030 the cabinet wants to use half as much 'wrong' building material. By 2050 there should even be a complete 'circular economy'.

A requirement that requires an enormous turnaround and effort from the construction sector. In her letters, Minister Ollongren has always proudly reported that her green plans have been approved 'in broad outline'. But, she admitted, it also creates some ambiguity. Those involved indicated that they needed a clear calculation method and a basic legal minimum. The House of Representatives warns that the green requirements should not hinder housing construction. The VVD calls on the minister to guard against this.
7. New construction without gas
The government wants to make the Netherlands natural gas-free by 2050. New construction must already be connected to a different heat source. A major effort that also demands a lot from the construction sector. According to the Court of Audit, Minister Ollongren is making it even more difficult than the task already is. Researchers note that the D66 minister has raised expectations that cannot be fulfilled at all.
The Court of Audit has come to the conclusion that different goals are mentioned each time in the spending plan, the budgets, the annual report of the Ministry of the Interior and answers to parliamentary questions. “It is unclear which goals the minister is pursuing at any time and which are not or are no longer being pursued.”
Moreover, the plan was to make more than 2,000 homes natural gas-free in 2018 and 2019, the Court of Audit said. “The Court of Audit notes that only a few homes were actually made natural gas-free at the end of 2019.” There is also criticism of the financing of making homes natural gas-free.
According to researchers, it appears to be a matter of 'money looking for a plan'. “The Minister of the Interior imposed a condition for receiving a financial contribution that municipalities must have an advanced plan to make homes natural gas-free. This raises the question for the Court of Audit whether those plans would not have gone ahead without the ministry's contribution.”
