ABSTRACT
The municipality of Krimpenerwaard wants the new river crossing to be located east of the Van Brienenoord Bridge, instead of near Feijenoord, and is prepared to do something to achieve this. But that decision should not be made hastily, says Kees Larooij. Citizens must be involved in weighing the consequences.
COMPLETE TEXT:
The traffic jams on the A16 and the Van Brienenoord Bridge are notorious. Anyone who has to cross the Algera Bridge also faces traffic jams every day. The solution was to create a second bank connection across the Nieuwe Maas, it was agreed during the administrative consultation on the Multi-Year Infrastructure Spatial and Transport Program (MIRT) in November 2018. After all, as an economically important location, Rotterdam must be easily accessible. There are now still 2 locations 'in the running' for this new bank connection: the East variant near Rotterdam Feijenoord and the East-East variant between Ridderkerk and the Krimpenerwaard. The choice must be made by mid-2019.
The bridge at Fijenoord is very popular because it offers major (economic) benefits within Rotterdam and is important for housing construction and urban public transport. The residents of De Esch absolutely disagree with this: they want to keep their green and relatively quiet living environment as it is: without a bridge.
In the shadow of these discussions, there have always been calls for better accessibility in the Krimpenerwaard. To be clear: there are 2 municipalities in the Krimpenerwaard: Krimpen aan den IJssel and the municipality of Krimpenerwaard; a total of approximately 85,000 inhabitants. Traditionally, the western part of the Krimpenerwaard has always been focused on Rotterdam. Others work in the Krimpenerwaard itself or in Gouda and the surrounding area: Central Holland.
The number of people from Krimpenerwaard who work in Rotterdam is increasing; At the same time, more and more Rotterdam residents are interested in the tranquility of the Krimpenerwaard. That peace and space is exactly what many residents of the Krimpenerwaard find so attractive: where can you count meadow birds or go fishing in the middle of the polder?
And that puts us right in the middle of the raging debate: preserve the green tranquility or create space for connection and economic development? A question that touches the essence of this part of the Green Heart. This certainly applies to the municipality of Krimpenerwaard. How much traffic will pass through? And won't we still be stuck in traffic jams for just as long? But with a lot of others? Will there soon be a national highway through the polder? It keeps people busy. There are also similar concerns in Ridderkerk.
I have always found it striking that the final choice between the two locations has to be made so quickly that it is virtually impossible to allow residents to participate effectively in the selection process. There have been information evenings, yes. However, the future environmental law (rightly) places much more emphasis on citizen participation. There is no time for that now. Only after choosing one location or another is there time for an in-depth look, together with residents of the area involved.
Citizens are now making themselves heard. For example, my eye recently fell on a petition that had been started in Capelle aan den IJssel. In it, the initiators argue in favor of the bank connection between the Krimpenerwaard and Ridderkerk. Precisely because they are so tired of not even leaving their neighborhood every day. The petition included an illuminating image, showing that traffic from Krimpen aan den IJssel, Krimpenerwaard and perhaps part of Capelle aan den IJssel is directed to the A16 via the new East-Oost bank connection (via Ridderkerk). This will relieve the Van Brienenoord Bridge, Kralingseplein and Algera Bridge.
The majority of the municipal council of the municipality of Krimpenerwaard is also in favor of that East-East variant. A lot of thought is being given to what this river connection is worth to us; what 'offer' the municipality will make to contribute to that river connection. However, one thing is clear to me: if you make an offer, it must also be clear what you get in return! In positive returns and negative consequences. It is important to know whether the travel time between the municipality of Krimpenerwaard and Rotterdam will soon be better. And what the impact is on nature and the living environment. Will the new infrastructure be adaptable in the future? The whole thing must be positive. After all, that's why you make an offer!
Kees Larooij Councilor Krimpenerwaard (CDA)
The discussion is: maintain the green tranquility or create space for connection and economic development
