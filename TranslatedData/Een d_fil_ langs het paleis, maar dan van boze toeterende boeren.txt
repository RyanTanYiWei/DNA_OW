Highlight: Protestant farmers now focused on King Willem-Alexander. They want him to refuse to sign the Environmental Act, but he already did that.
Body


Honking, they walk at a walking pace past Huis ten Bosch Palace. The standard is flying, the king is home. They come from Heerlen (Limburg), Markelo (Overijssel), Niezijl (Groningen). Angry farmers, surprisingly often with their son or daughter in the cabin.
The parade lasts almost three hours. Taken by the board of Farmers Defense Force standing on the roadside in front of the palace, such as Rutger van Lier, in an outfit that resembles the large outfit of the Royal Navy that the king wears. He waves to the farmers with a royal wave.
The farmers had actually wanted to demonstrate at the palace, so they had to stop there. To once again express their dissatisfaction with the government's nitrogen measures, and to protest against the Environmental Act, which combines dozens of spatial planning laws.
The introduction of the Environmental Act has been postponed until 2022, but farmers fear that it will mean that farmers will be expropriated, that every farmer within a radius of ten kilometers of a Natura 2000 area will be bought out. According to them, it means “a professional ban”.
They want Willem-Alexander to refuse to sign the law. “His signature seals the fate of all farmers,” says Mark van den Oever of Farmers Defense Force. But the king already signed it in 2016, after the Environmental Act was adopted by both Houses.
 In June, the implementing law for the Environmental Act was on his desk for signature. The fact that parliament is still discussing the implementation law is because there are still ICT problems, for example. The sentence about expropriation of land is a standard sentence that is more often included in laws.
The nitrogen law still has to be discussed by the House of Representatives and the Senate before the king can sign it.
Read about the criticism of the
Kitchen table
Yet the farmers go to The Hague. Among them Mark Vaessen from Heerlen. “I hope to show that we are still here,” he says. “The whole of Limburg is in the ten-kilometer zone around a Natura 2000 area.” And about the reason why his sons aged 11, 10 and 7 are with us: “We talk about it at the kitchen table. They get it.”
Piet van Kampen and his Bart (15) come from Deurne. “My potential successor,” Van Kampen points to his son. They have a dairy farm with seventy cows. “Sustainability means earning a good living and passing your business on to the next generation,” says father. Although, according to him, that chance is "increasingly smaller" due to all the regulations. According to him, the protest is "a final appeal to politics."
A demonstration in front of the palace is not allowed. A small delegation goes to the King's Cabinet, Willem-Alexander's official secretariat, to present a petition. The other hundreds of farmers are holding a demonstration at the Koekamp park, opposite The Hague Central Station. Little attention is paid to distance rules, and face masks are rare.
Thinking of Holland
A 'letter for the king' will be read from the stage by Lucinda Middelhof. She says that nowadays her husband is “more often behind than in the house.” “There is too much time to think at home.” Sieta van Keimpema presents a variation on Marsman's Memory of Holland ('Thinking of Holland...'). In her Holland it is not the wide rivers that flow slowly through endless lowlands, but wide roads. Instead of groups of trees, villages and truncated towers, there are buildings and data centers.
The event goes smoothly, as does the parade at the palace. The water cannon remains on standby there. Police blockades are circumvented, two farmers are arrested and, contrary to agreements, people park on the Malieveld and drive over the grass. Last spring, farmers paid for the sowing after they destroyed the grass during an earlier demonstration last October. Now the hikers are once again leaving deep tracks, two forest rangers are watching, shaking their heads.
