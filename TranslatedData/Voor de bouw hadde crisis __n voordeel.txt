ABSTRACT
Slow decision making
The Crisis and Recovery Act of 2010 put an end to long procedures. The 'temporary' support gave construction projects wings.
COMPLETE TEXT:
Everything moves faster during a crisis. “The lines are super short. Positive forces are being released," says Carla Moonen, chairman of the trade association Royal NLengineers.
Ten years ago this Tuesday, a temporary law came into effect that was intended to combat the loss of jobs during the crisis at the time: the Crisis and Recovery Act. "There are many parallels with now," says Moonen. Just like then, there is a "great willingness to realize a breakthrough" and limit the consequences of a crisis. "People want to save what can be saved."
Moonen, also a senator for D66, was closely involved in drafting the Crisis and Recovery Act ten years ago. She was a consultant at the Ministry of General Affairs, for then Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende (CDA). "It was the time when the financial crisis spread to the real economy. Wouter Bos [then Minister of Finance, PvdA] was saving the banks and Balkenende wondered what else the government could do to soften the effects on employment."
In those years, there was a lot of dissatisfaction about complicated rules and procedures, which could endlessly delay construction projects. Moonen: "Balkenende saw with his own eyes in Utrecht that fifteen hundred permits were required for the renovation of the station area. For inner-city projects, the lead time was ten to fifteen years."
Former DSM CEO Peter Elverding had already advised to accelerate decision-making for the construction of infrastructure, and Delft University of Technology advocated breaking the "impasse" in construction. Carla Moonen: "After meetings at a European summit in Brussels We discussed the issue in a restaurant. Balkenende came up with the idea for a temporary law that would speed up procedures and stimulate sustainable initiatives. I was put in charge of making that law, which had to be ready in six months."
Effects 'unclear'
With a team of three lawyers from three ministries, Moonen looked for unnecessary rules and major annoyances and obstacles in construction. Such as provisions from the Waste Act that make sustainability impossible, delays in the construction of the Second Maasvlakte due to temporary exceeding of environmental standards, governments litigating against each other, overlapping environmental impact assessments and last but not least time-consuming legal proceedings at the Council of State.
It would have been close if the law, drawn up in record time, would not have come into effect on March 31, 2010. Moonen: "The cabinet fell in February 2010 and it was very exciting whether the Senate would subsequently declare the law controversial and not deal with it. I remember coming to the Binnenhof and the Secretary General of General Affairs said to me: Carla, maybe all the work was for nothing." Ultimately, a vote was taken.
With the law, four hundred projects have been realized in two hundred municipalities in ten years; several dozen more are added every year. Seven years ago, the law was made permanent by the second Rutte cabinet, despite criticism from the Council of State that the effects of the law were "unclear".
What's up with that? "The law has generated a lot of work," says Diederik Bel, sector director of the built environment at consultancy and engineering firm Witteveen+Bos. "What has especially helped is certainty about appeal procedures; in the case of permits, the court can be skipped and the procedure takes a long time. at the Council of State never longer than six months."
Energy transition
Unfortunately, according to Bel, it takes a long time to get a project on the list that brings it under the scope of the law. "That sometimes takes a year." He hopes that the new Environmental Act, which will soon include the Crisis and Recovery Act, will work faster. And that more projects for energy transition and climate adaptation will be included. Bel: "There are the law helped many traditional construction projects. I would say: never waste a good crisis and pay more attention to other projects."
In addition to satisfied voices from governments and the construction industry, the law has also provoked resistance. For example, the law would make participation more difficult and decisions would be 'pushed through'. Moonen: “That was never the intention. The fact that rules have disappeared has actually removed the obstacles to participation in many cases."
Bel: "The law limits the interest of objectors to people who live nearby and are directly harmed. This puts professional objectors at a distance. Subsequently, more clubs have emerged that can jointly object. In a country like the Netherlands, a counter-movement will always be organized."
The crisis had one advantage for construction: less bureaucratic hassle
With the law, 400 projects have been realized in 200 municipalities in ten years
In addition to satisfaction from construction and governments, the law also aroused resistance
