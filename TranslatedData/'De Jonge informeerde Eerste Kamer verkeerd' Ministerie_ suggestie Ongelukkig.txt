Ministry: suggestion Unfortunate
The Hague - Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Housing) has misinformed the Senate about the Environment Act, according to ICT experts. In response to questions from the senators, the CDA member suggested that everything was fine with the complex computer system, but that was far from the truth according to the software experts.
The ministry acknowledges in a response that a mistake was made. "Unfortunately, the details of the answer suggested that there would be no changes to the system as of April. However, small changes still had to be made." According to a spokesperson for Hugo de Jonge, the slip was later corrected in a new cabinet letter to the Senate. The matter was also further explained orally, he says.
