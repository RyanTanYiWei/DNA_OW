The Hague. Construction decision-making becomes easier and faster. This is the aim of the new Environmental Act that was adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday. The law incorporates almost thirty existing laws or parts thereof.
The Environmental Act shortens procedures by merging permits, bringing forward consultation and removing the obligation to conduct frequent research. Minister Schultz van Haegen (Infrastructure and Environment, VVD) is counting on savings of 600 million euros. According to her, this mainly benefits governments, such as municipalities, but also companies and citizens.
When making decisions about construction projects, municipalities must continue to adhere to "strict standards" for safety and the environment, and they must also not go against general visions of the national government or provinces. But municipalities are given more room for experiments, for example by deviating of general standards for noise and odor if this improves the living environment as a whole.
Minister Schultz van Haegen: “This law aims to make things possible. As an alderman you will no longer be able to hide behind rules. You can no longer say to citizens and companies who want something: nice idea, but it is not allowed."
What is allowed in one municipality will not be allowed in another municipality. Is that arbitrary? "I prefer to speak of differentiation rather than arbitrariness," said the minister. "Whether sensible choices are made depends largely on the local administrators and on the municipal council that controls them. I hope that this law will not only simplify procedures but also stimulates creativity."
