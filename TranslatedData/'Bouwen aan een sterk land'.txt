Members of the States General,
        Now that I can address you for the first time today on Budget Day, I would like to say that in your United Assembly on April 30 you have initiated a heart-warming start to my reign. It is a day that I remember with great gratitude. That gratitude concerns first and foremost my mother. She has worked for the Kingdom and all its inhabitants for 33 years with great sense of duty, warmth and deeply felt commitment, in good and bad times. She remains an important source of inspiration for me. The feelings of solidarity that my family and I experienced after the death of my brother Friso were of great support to us. We are very grateful for that.
        On the day of the inauguration, the Netherlands showed itself to the world as a well-organized country, rich in talent. It was also a day of tangible unity and connection, between generations and population groups and between the different parts of the Kingdom. There is much in our society that justifies healthy confidence in our own abilities. It is good to be able to note this just before the start of the celebration of the two hundred years of the Kingdom.
        Members of the States General,
        The Netherlands has been struggling with the economic crisis for five years. The consequences are becoming increasingly tangible. Unemployment is rising, the number of bankruptcies is increasing, houses are becoming less valuable, pensions are under pressure and purchasing power is lagging behind. There are cautious signs that the end of the global crisis is in sight. This also creates prospects for recovery for our country. This does not alter the fact that the Dutch economy is struggling with a number of specific problems of a structural nature, including the debt burden of the government and households and the capital position of banks.
        The government wants to strengthen the growth capacity of the Dutch economy. This lays the foundation for creating jobs and restoring confidence among people and companies. The necessary reforms take time and require perseverance. Due to social developments such as an aging population and internationalization, our labor market and our system of public facilities no longer fully meet the requirements of today. The financial and economic crisis has made this clear once again. The government is not only committed to future affordability of facilities, but also to solidarity between generations and balance between different income groups. Mutual involvement has traditionally been strong in our country. To ensure that this remains the case, we must recognize that public arrangements and facilities must be adapted.
        It is undeniable that people in our current network and information society are more assertive and independent than before. Combined with the need to reduce the government deficit, this means that the classical welfare state is slowly but surely changing into a participation society. Everyone who can do this is asked to take responsibility for his or her own life and environment.
        When people shape their own future, they not only add value to their own lives, but also to society as a whole. In this way, the Dutch continue to build a strong country of self-confident people together. A country with a compact and powerful government, which provides space and opportunities where possible and protects when necessary, so that no one falls through the cracks. Every Dutch person must be given the opportunity to incorporate the changes that await us into their own lives.
        The relationship between parliament and government will be dominated by a lot of legislation in the coming year. Based on the coalition agreement and its elaboration in agreements with social partners and other social parties, the government will submit proposals to you.
        What is and remains crucial is 'a prudent level of government debt', as the Central Planning Bureau called it earlier this year. Currently, all Dutch people together pay 11 billion euros per year in interest on government debt, even with the current low interest rates. If the debt grows and interest rates rise, the interest burden will increasingly weigh on economic growth, the affordability of services and people's incomes.
        Without intervention, the government deficit will remain too high. The government is therefore presenting you with additional measures totaling 6 billion euros. The government will not pay a wage adjustment for the last time in 2014. In healthcare, agreements have been made to provide a larger part of the care through the GP and to be stricter with the provision of insured care. The government will make a proposal to bundle various allowances and schemes into one household allowance, which will decrease as family income rises.
        The government is also introducing measures that will stimulate the economy and employment in the short term. This gives people the opportunity to have severance payments that have been placed in a separate BV paid out more quickly at an advantageous tax rate. The exemption from gift tax is being expanded, making it easier for younger generations to invest in their own home. To increase access to credit, the government will release 125 million euros in 2013. This allows small and medium-sized businesses to invest in new activities.
        Entrepreneurs also have the option of accelerated tax depreciation of investments. The government will establish a Dutch investment institution together with pension funds, insurers and banks. The aim of this institution is to link major investors to suitable investment projects in areas such as healthcare, energy, school buildings and infrastructure, in order to stimulate the economy.
        To keep and get as many people as possible into work, the government is making 600 million euros available. As agreed in the Social Agreement, employers and employees come up with sector plans for this. These are aimed at more jobs and internships for young people, retention of skilled workers and better guidance from work to work. To combat youth unemployment, the government is working with municipalities, social partners and educational institutions to get young people into work and increase their chances on the labor market. The Education Agreement aims to create 3,000 extra jobs to help or keep young teachers working. The Technology Pact ensures a better connection between education and the labor market and combats the shortage of technically trained professionals. The Energy Agreement stimulates sustainable economic growth and creates 15,000 extra jobs. The Environmental Act simplifies and accelerates spatial procedures, without compromising the quality of the living environment.
        For the long term, the government is working on reforms that will strengthen the growth capacity of the Dutch economy and adapt our public services to current requirements.
        The transition to a participation society is particularly visible in social security and long-term care. The classical welfare state from the second half of the twentieth century has produced regulations in these areas that are unsustainable in their current form and no longer meet people's expectations. In this day and age, people want to make their own choices, organize their own lives and take care of each other. It is in keeping with this development to organize care and social facilities close to people and in cohesion. To achieve this, the government is decentralizing government tasks in three areas.
        Firstly, the government recently made a proposal to you for a new youth care system with effect from 2015. Children must grow up safely and be able to develop their talents in order to later participate in society to the best of their ability. The new system brings youth care close to the child through the municipalities. Municipalities in particular are able to provide tailor-made solutions based on the specific situation of the child who needs help, in consultation with other domains, such as housing, education, safety and sports.
        Secondly, in the coming parliamentary year, the government will present a proposal to thoroughly reform long-term care. This is necessary because expenditure for this continues to rise explosively. These already amount to 2,200 euros per Dutch person per year. Lighter forms of long-term care will soon be provided by municipalities, which can better assess whether a stair lift or taxi allowance is necessary. Reimbursement for domestic help remains available for people who really need this help and cannot pay for it themselves. Medical care such as nursing will soon be covered by regular health insurance.
        Thirdly, municipalities will set up work companies together with social partners to help people on social assistance or with a disability find a job. Employers and the government jointly guarantee 125,000 additional jobs by 2026. If it turns out that this number will not be achieved, companies will still be obliged to recruit a percentage of their staff from people with disabilities. You will receive the bill to this effect this autumn.
        Following this, the Unemployment Act and dismissal law will also be modernized. The unemployment benefit will have a more activating character. Social partners take the lead in guidance from work to work, for example through training. The government limits the publicly financed part of the unemployment benefit to 24 months. Social partners take responsibility for a privately financed part of the unemployment benefit. This creates an additional incentive for employers and employees to invest in the quality of people. Employees who are in danger of being dismissed receive a training budget. Flex workers receive more security and more protection. Dismissal law becomes fairer and simpler by prescribing one dismissal route for all employees.
        In the area of ​​the housing market, the government has already taken decisions, such as mandatory annuity repayments for new mortgages as a condition for the deduction of mortgage interest. As of 2014, the government wants to gradually reduce the maximum deduction for owner-occupied homes to 38 percent. This will happen in 28 annual increments of half a percent. The proceeds from this measure will benefit people with a middle income through an extension of the third tax bracket. To reform the rental market, the government is opting for income-related rent increases. The additional income from this is collected from the housing associations by means of a landlord levy.
        With these domestic reforms, the government is preparing the Netherlands for the future. Due to growing international interconnectedness, continued attention must be paid to developments beyond our national borders.
        Our open economy has brought us a lot, but it also makes our country extra vulnerable in times of international crisis and stagnation. Cooperation with other countries, and certainly with those around us, is in the interests of the Netherlands. Recent years have shown how developments in the European Union are significant for the economic, social and political future of our country. The Netherlands must therefore play an active role in the European Union.
        A solid foundation under the euro is crucial. That is why the government is committed to the creation of a banking union. Sustainable deficits and strengthening the economic structure continue to require attention. Opportunities to strengthen the competitiveness and growth capacity of the Member States lie in the European internal market. There are still too many obstacles in some areas. In addition, trade with countries outside the European Union can be boosted by concluding free trade agreements with, among others, the United States and Japan. A spearhead for the government is the discussion about the tasks of the European Union. Member States can better arrange a number of matters themselves, such as taxes, social security, pensions, healthcare and education. The government will take the lead in this and enter into discussions about this with the other member states.
        The Netherlands also has a long tradition of international cooperation outside the European Union. This recently became visible during the celebration of the centenary of the Peace Palace. Next year, our country will host the Nuclear Security Summit, where leaders from all over the world will make agreements to combat nuclear terrorism. The recent violence and humanitarian emergency in Syria underline the need for an international legal order with a strong emphasis on humanitarian law. Insecurity and instability in vulnerable regions affect our freedom, security and prosperity. This requires an armed force that is prepared for its tasks and that can operate in the Netherlands and abroad to safeguard the interests of our country. In the memorandum 'In the interests of the Netherlands', the government specifies what the armed forces look like and what adjustments are necessary for this. Dutch men and women are active all over the world to protect the international legal order. They deserve our great thanks and appreciation for their difficult work.
        With the 'new agenda for aid, trade and investments', the government is giving shape and substance to the objective of linking traditional forms of development aid with strengthening trade relations. It is a mutually beneficial combination. For example, the Dutch business community has a lot of expertise in water management. We help countries in all parts of the world solve their water problems.
        The constitutional relationship between the Netherlands and the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom changed in 2010. Since then, increasing attention has been paid to cooperation in the economic field. That is beneficial for all parties. It also contributes to the necessary financial independence and stability of the Caribbean islands, all six of which I will soon visit together with Queen Máxima.
        Members of the States General,
        To maintain the strength and quality of our society, changes are necessary, which must be bearable for everyone. The government wants to work with full dedication on the resulting assignment in the parliamentary year ahead, together with you. The issues you will be considering are complex and far-reaching. You may feel supported in your difficult task by the realization that many wish you wisdom and pray with me for strength and God's blessing for you.
