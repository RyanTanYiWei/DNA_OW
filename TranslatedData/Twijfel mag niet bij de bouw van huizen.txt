The waiting lists for a rental home and the rising prices of owner-occupied homes are signals that there is a dire shortage of housing. But as easy as this conclusion is, it turns out to be difficult to build on a large scale. Of course, there are obstacles such as expensive raw materials and a lack of construction workers.
Even more often, however, new construction hardly gets off the ground due to the difficult procedures that provinces and municipalities have to implement. Due to patchwork of permits and constantly changing rules, processes are stuck.
Precisely to streamline this patchwork, the cabinet wants to introduce the Environmental Act by the middle of next year. This law makes procedures faster and simpler. But serious signals are now coming from the municipalities that the Environmental Act does not make the complicated procedures easier. In fact, municipalities warn, new construction is actually delayed or even paralyzed.
When almost all laws are introduced, there is some wrangling beforehand, because negative consequences are feared. Panic is not always necessary, but in this case the social consequences are very serious. The outgoing cabinet must be sure that the Environmental Act contributes to the construction of more houses. There should be no doubt about this in advance.
